Activity
========

The Activity section displays a recent activity report for Auditing. |morpheus| defines an activity as any major action performed on an instance or server, such as, but not limited to adding a server, deleting a server, provisioning an instance, deleting an instance, creating a backup, etcâ€¦ This view can be searched and filtered by type, user, and date range.

Activity
--------

There are four types of activities that are displayed in the Activity Reports:

- Backup
- Provisioning
- Alert

**To View a Recent Activity report:**

#. Select the ``Operations`` link in the navigation bar.
#. Select ``Activity`` in the sub navigation bar.

Recent activity is displayed in order from recent to oldest. This view can be searched and filtered by type, user, and date range.

**Review**

To review the item that generated the activity, click the name of the activity and it will go to a new page and display that item. The list of activity can be filtered by type, user or date range.

.. NOTE:: Deleted activities are displayed as an alert and do not contain a link to the event item. If the activity is not a deletion event we provide a link on the activity name to go to the item the activity occurred on. Delete activity alerts are shown for Instances, servers, Clouds, and Groups.

Alarms
------

The `ALARMS` section shows Operation notifications from Cloud and other Service Integrations. Cloud and other Service Integration Alarms are not generated by |morpheus| but synced and displayed for visibility in |morpheus|.

History
-------

The `HISTORY` section shows process history from Instance processes. This is an aggregate view of the ``History`` tab contained in each Instance detail page.

Processes can be expanded to view all process steps and process history detail including output and errors.

Access to `HISTORY` is given by the ``Operations:Activity`` Role permission.

  Morpheus Logs
  -------------

  The Logs displayed in ``Administration - Health - Morpheus Logs`` are from ``/var/log/morpheus/morpheus-ui/current``. These logs show all ui activity and are useful for troubleshooting and auditing.

  .. NOTE:: Stack traces in ``Administration - Health - Morpheus Logs`` are filtered for |morpheus| services. Complete stack traces can be found in ``/var/log/morpheus/morpheus-ui/current``.
