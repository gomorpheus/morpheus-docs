  <p>=== Configuring Accounts and Resources for Multi-Tenancy</p>
<p>A very common scenario for Managed Service Providers is the need to provide access to resources on a customer by customer basis. Several administrative features are available in |morpheus| to ensure customer resources are properly scoped and isolated. With its built multi-tenancy capabilities and white label support, managed service providers have a wide range of capabilities when it comes to managing customer accounts and users.</p>
<p>==== Accounts</p>
<p>There are essentially two types of accounts in |morpheus| </p>
<p>Master Account
Sub Accounts</p>
<p>During the initial setup of a |morpheus| Appliance, the Master Account is created. All accounts created in addition to this Master Account are sub-accounts. There can only be one Master Account, and sub-accounts cannot become the Master Account. The delineation between the Master Account and sub-accounts is important to understand for properly scoping resources across accounts.</p>
<p>Creating Accounts</p>
<p>The Master Account is created during the initial appliance setup. Additional sub-accounts can be created in the Admin -&gt; Accounts section.</p>
<p>The Accounts page displays a list of all accounts. This page enables users to: Create, Edit, and Delete accounts. The list of accounts displays the account Name, Role, Total Instances, Total Users, and the Created Date. Click the Account Name to drill into the Account View where you can again Edit, Delete, as well as Create Users, Edit Users, and Delete Users users belonging to the account.</p>
<p>At least one account in addition to the Master Account is required to scope resources across accounts.</p>
<p>To create a new sub-account</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Select the Admin link in the navigation bar.</li>
<li>Select the Accounts link in the sub navigation bar.</li>
<li>Click the Create Account button.</li>
<li>From the New Account wizard input</li>
</ol>
<p>Name
Description(optional)
Base Role- Primary role of the account. All roles created within the account must inherit this role as the base role.
Currency (for pricing)
Limits- These restrict the amount of Storage, Memory, and CPUs that can be collectively provisioned by all users in the account. The default is 0 for these limits, which means no limits will be applied.
5. Click the Save Changes button.</p>
<p>Viewing Accounts</p>
<p>To View an individual Account page, select the Account name from the main Accounts section.</p>
<p>From inside this account view, the account settings can be edited, existing users can be viewed or edited, and new users for this account can be created.</p>
<p>Create a new user for an account</p>
<p>To create a new user for an account (Note: Users are specific to each account. Users created in the Master Account or other sub-accounts will only have access to the account they are created in.)*</p>
<p>Click the CREATE USER button
From the New User wizard input the fields below.
First Name of the user being created
Last Name of the user being created
Username used to login
Email address of the new user
Role to be inherited by the user
Password
Storage, Memory and CPU limits for this specific user, if any
Click Save Changes.</p>
<p>Impersonate User (v2.8.6 or later)</p>
<p>In version 2.8.6 or later, “Impersonate User” is a new Role enabling administrators to login as sub-account users directly from the master account.</p>
<p>To impersonate a user, you must be logged in as a user with the “Impersonate User” feature enabled in assigned role.</p>
<p>Navigate to Accounts, select an account, and in the specific user ACTIONS drop down, select “Impersonate”</p>
<p>This will log you in as that user in their respective account. To log out of the impersonate users account, select the username in the top right, and then select “Quit Impersonating”</p>
<p>Resource Visibility and Assigning Resources to Accounts
In the Master Account, resources can be configured with private or public visibility:
Private Visibility: Only available to the assigned account.
Public Visibility (master account only): Available across all accounts
Resources in the Master Account can also be assigned directly to sub-accounts. When a resource is assigned to a sub-account, it is only available for that sub-account, and its visibility is automatically set to private. Public Visibility is not an option for any resource assigned to or created in a sub-account.</p>
<p>From the master account, the following resources can be configured for public visibility across all accounts, or assigned to individual sub-accounts</p>
<p>Clouds
Hosts
Virtual Machines
Networks
Datastores
Resource Pools
Virtual Image Templates
Pricing
Policies
Workflows
Roles
<a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>Virtual Image Templates can also be made available to multiple select accounts when set to private.</p>
<p>Cloud Visibility &amp; Assignment</p>
<p>Edit Visibility of a Cloud</p>
<p>To set the Visibility of cloud to Public (shared across all accounts) or Private (only available to the assigned account):</p>
<p>Navigate to Infrastructure, Clouds
Select either the pencil/edit icon on the far right of the cloud row, or click the name of the cloud and select “Edit” in the top right of the cloud page.
From the “Visibility” drop down, select either “Public” or “Private”
Select “Save Changes” in the lower right of the Edit Cloud modal.</p>
<p>When a cloud is set to Public visibility, it is available to be added to sub accounts. All sub-accounts created after a master account cloud is set to public will automatically have clouds with public visibility added, and a group will be created for each available cloud matching the cloud name in the new sub account(s).</p>
<p>For accounts created prior to a Master Account cloud being set to public visibility, the sub account will have the option to add that cloud but it will not automatically be added.</p>
<p>While the cloud will be available for sub-accounts, the resources available in that cloud to the sub-account(s) depends on the visibility or assignment of the individual resources.</p>
<p>Note: A sub-account user must have sufficient role permissions/cloud access to add publicly available clouds. Master Account clouds settings cannot be edited from sub accounts.</p>
<p>Assign a Cloud to an Account</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: When assigning a Cloud to an account, all resources for that Cloud will only be available to the assigned account. If a cloud is created in the Master Account and assigned to a sub-account, it will no longer be available for use by the Master Account or any other sub-accounts, although it can be assigned back to the Master account, or to another sub-account.</p>
<p>It may be preferable for service providers to share or assign their cloud resources, such as specific hosts, networks, resources pools and datastores, across sub-accounts, rather than an entire cloud.</p>
<p>To assign a cloud from the Master Account to a sub-account:</p>
<p>Navigate to Infrastructure, Clouds
Select either the pencil/edit icon on the far right of the cloud row, or click the name of the cloud and select “Edit” in the top right of the cloud page.
From the “Account” drop down, select the account to assign the cloud to. The visibility will automatically be set to “Private” when a cloud is assigned to a sub-account.
Select “Save Changes” in the lower right of the Edit Cloud modal.</p>
<p>When a cloud is assigned to a sub-account, or assigned to the Master Account with private visibility, that cloud and all of its resources are only available to the assigned account. The Master account still maintains control and visibility, and can edit the cloud settings or re-assign the cloud.</p>
<p>Resource Visibility &amp; Assignment</p>
<p>Similar to clouds, individual resources from the Master Account can be set to public and available to sub-accounts, or assigned to sub-accounts.</p>
<p>By default, any host, virtual machine, bare metal server, network, resource pool, datastore or template added, created or inventoried by an account is assigned to that account. If these resources are in the Master Account, they can be assigned to sub accounts. Assigning one of these resources will make it unavailable to the Master Account, but it will still be visible and editable by the Master Account. This allows Master Account resources to be isolated for use by sub-accounts while still under the control of the Master Account.</p>
<p>Resources assigned to sub-accounts from the Master Account will be visible and available for use by that sub-account, however they cannot be edited or re-assigned by the sub-accout.</p>
<p>Set the Visibility of a Host, Virtual Machine or Bare metal Server to Public or Private</p>
<p>From the Master Account, navigate to Infrastructure, Hosts
Select either the Hosts, Virtual Machines or Bare Metal tab
Click the name of the resource
Select “Edit” in the top right of the resource page to bring up the config modal.
From the “Visibility” drop down, select either “Public” or “Private”
Select “Save Changes” in the lower right of the modal</p>
<p>Assigning a Host, Virtual Machine, or Bare Metal server to an Account</p>
<p>From the Master Account, navigate to Infrastructure, Hosts
Select either the Hosts, Virtual Machines or Bare Metal tab
Click the name of the resource
From the “Actions” dropdown in the top right of the resource page, select Assign Account
In the Assign Account modal, select the account to assign the resource to.
Select “Execute” in the lower right of the modal
The resource will now be assigned and available for use by the assigned account. If assigned to a sub-account, the Master Account will maintain visibility and control.</p>
<p>Set the Visibility of a Network to Public or Private</p>
<p>From the Master Account, navigate to Infrastructure, Network
Select either the pencil/edit icon on the far right of the network row, or click the name of the network and select “Edit” in the top right of the network page.
From the “Visibility” drop down, select either “Public” or “Private”
Select “Save Changes” in the lower right of the modal</p>
<p>Assign a Network to an Account</p>
<p>From the Master Account, navigate to Infrastructure, Network
Select either the pencil/edit icon on the far right of the network row, or click the name of the network and select “Edit” in the top right of the network page.
From the “Account” drop down, select an account to assign the network to.
Select “Save Changes” in the lower right of the modal</p>
<p>The Network will now be assigned and available for use by the assigned account. If assigned to a sub-account, the Master Account will maintain visibility and control.</p>
<p>Set the Visibility or assign a datastore to an Account</p>
<p>From the Master Account, navigate to Infrastructure, Storage
Select the “Data Stores” tab
Select Edit from the “Actions” dropdown on the far right of the datastores row
From the “Visibility” drop down, select either “Public” or “Private”
From the “Account” drop down, select the account to assign the datastore to.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Note: If assigned to a sub-account, the visibility will automatically set to private.</div></blockquote>
<p>Select “Save Changes” in the lower right of the modal</p>
<p>Set the Visibility or assign a Virtual Image to an Account</p>
<p>From the Master Account, navigate to Provisioning, Virtual Images
Select Edit from the “Actions” dropdown on the far right of the Virtual Images row
From the “Visibility” drop down, select either “Public” or “Private”. Public will share the
From the “Account” field, start typing the name of the account to assign the Virtual Image to. Matching accounts will populate, then select the account to add.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Note: Virtual Images can be set to Private, but accessible to more that one account</div></blockquote>
<p>Repeat step 4 for all accounts requiring access to the virtual image.
To remove access for an account, click the “x” next to the account name
Select “Save Changes” in the lower right of the modal</p>
<p>The Virtual Image will now be available for use by the assigned accounts.</p>
