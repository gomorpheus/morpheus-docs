<p>=== High Availability Mode</p>
<p>|morpheus| ships as a stand-alone appliance running as a virtual machine
in your own environment. This stand-alone appliance contains all the
software needed to run |morpheus| and uses a package to distribute the
binary files. A configuration utility is also provided to configure the
software based on your environment needs. As |morpheus| scales and
becomes a more critical component of your infrastructure the stand-alone
method does not meet the needs in terms of uptime availability and
scalability. We have designed the components that makeup |morpheus| 
distributable to enable you to deploy it in a multi-tier configuration.
This document discusses the possible deployment scenarios and use cases
for distributing |morpheus| and increasing its uptime availability.</p>
<p>Each tier described in the following architecture section can be scaled
out to increase its availability. To remove the single points of failure
from inside the stand-alone appliance you will need to stand up each of
the architecture components described in the architecture section.
System administration of these components are critical to the success of
a highly scaled system including logging and monitoring. The
infrastructure setup section goes over the details of setting up the
proper infrastructure to allow the application servers to talk to these
services directly rather than the internal services created by the
installer in a stand-alone configuration.</p>
<p>==== Architecture</p>
<p>|morpheus| contains the following tiers in the stand-alone deployment
configuration: web, application, cache, message queue, search index, and
database. Each tier can be distributed and deployed on separate servers
except for the cache. Currently the cache is localized to each
application server and is scheduled for removal in a later release. In
addition, there is a shared storage tier which holds artifacts and
backup objects.</p>
<p>image::src/asciidoc/images/getting_started/morpheusHA.png[]</p>
<p>Web Tier:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">morpheus</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="n">uses</span> <span class="n">Nginx</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">reverse</span> <span class="n">proxy</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">its</span> <span class="n">application</span> <span class="n">tier</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="n">It</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>also serves access to the localized package repository used when
deploying data nodes and virtual machines providing the |morpheus| agent
and utility software.</p>
<p>Application Tier:</p>

</div>
<p>multiple servers behind a web connection load balancer that supports
websockets. The application itself runs in a Java virtual machine as an
Apache Tomcat container.</p>
<p>Cache Tier:</p>
<p>Currently |morpheus| uses a caching layer for database requests, this
component is scheduled for removal in a future release. A local instance
of Redis is used as the cache and is not distributed. The packaged
installer will install a local Redis instance to use until the component
is removed from the application.</p>
<p>Message Queue Tier:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">morpheus</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="n">uses</span> <span class="n">message</span> <span class="n">queueing</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">send</span> <span class="n">messages</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">different</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>components of the application that enable various actions. RabbitMQ is
used as the message broker, only the application communicates with the
message queue broker. This component is scaled horizontally behind a
load balancer so that each application server can connect to the broker
using a single DNS name.</p>
<p>Search Index Tier:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">morpheus</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="n">stores</span> <span class="n">activity</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">backup</span> <span class="n">results</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">logs</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">statistics</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">an</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>index to enable searching using ElasticSearch. Scaling out ElasticSearch
is handled by ElasticSearch itself and does not require a load balancer.
Each application server’s configuration contains addresses for each
ElasticSearch.</p>
<p>Database Tier:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">morpheus</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="n">use</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">SQL</span> <span class="n">persistent</span> <span class="n">database</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">stand</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">alone</span> <span class="n">appliance</span><span class="p">,</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>it is MySQL. To scale out the database tier setup a SQL compliant
database. Each application instance will need write access to the
database. Configuring MySQL or Percona database engine in an
active/active cluster will allow write access to the |morpheus| database
from any application server.</p>
<p>Shared Storage:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">morpheus</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="n">creates</span> <span class="n">artifacts</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">objects</span> <span class="n">when</span> <span class="n">deploying</span> <span class="n">applications</span> <span class="ow">or</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>running backups. These artifacts need to be written to a file system.
These objects need to be accessible by any application server they need
to exist on a shared storage device. |morpheus| allows you to create
storage providers such as a local directory, AWS S3, Swift, or cloud
CDNs.</p>
<p>Infrastructure Setup:</p>
<p>Infrastructure required for the external services should be deployed in
a regional manner and should not cross WAN boundaries with high latency
links. You can setup the external services in any cloud provider,
on-premises internal cloud or data center, or virtual environment.
Scaling and performance metrics of the external services are based on
recommendations from each service’s owner or community.</p>
<p>==== Configuration</p>
<p>|morpheus| configuration is controlled by a configuration file located
at /etc/morpheus/morpheus.rb. This file is read when you run
morpheus-ctl reconfigure after installing the appliance package. Each
section is tied to a deployment tier: database is mysql, message queue
is rabbitmq, serach index is elasticsearch. There are no entries for the
web and application tiers since those are part of the core application
server where the configuration file resides.</p>
<p>An example configuration file for a distributed |morpheus| deployment:</p>
<div class="section" id="source-bash">
<h1>.. code-block:: bash<a class="headerlink" href="#source-bash" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>mysql[‘enable’] = false mysql[‘host’] = {‘52.53.240.28’ =&gt; 10004,
‘52.53.241.94’ =&gt; 10004} mysql[‘morpheus_db’] = ‘morpheusdb01’
mysql[‘morpheus_db_user’] = ‘merovingian’ mysql[‘morpheus_password’]
= ‘Wm5n5gXqXCe9v52’ rabbitmq[‘enable’] = false rabbitmq[‘vhost’] =
‘zion’ rabbitmq[‘queue_user’] = ‘dujour’
rabbitmq[‘queue_user_password’] = ‘5tfg9n2iBifzW5c’ rabbitmq[‘host’] =
‘rabbitmq-lb01.morpheusdata.com’ rabbitmq[‘port’] = ‘10008’
rabbitmq[‘stomp_port’] = ‘10010’ rabbitmq[‘heartbeat’] = 50
elasticsearch[‘enable’] = false elasticsearch[‘cluster’] =
‘nebuchadnezzar’ elasticsearch[‘es_hosts’] = {‘52.53.214.68’ =&gt; 10003,
‘52.53.242.129’ =&gt; 10003, ‘52.53.68.67’ =&gt; 10003} —-</p>
<p>==== Database Tier</p>
<p>|morpheus| will install a local MySQL server in its stand-alone
configuration mode. To disable creating the local MySQL server set the
entry mysql[‘enable’] = false and add one or more database servers using
the mysql[‘host’] entry. This entry is a Ruby hash using hash rocket
style syntax since the key contains dots. The key is an IP address or
DNS name with the paired value the port the database is listening on.
The configuration script for the installer will take the values and turn
them into a URL JDBC string that the application will use. Enter the
database name and credentials using the entries mysql[‘morpheus_db’],
mysql[‘morpheus_db_user’], and mysql[‘morpheus_password’]
respectively. The database user requires write access to all tables in
the |morpheus| database with the all privileges statement.</p>
<p>==== Message Queue Tier</p>
<p>RabbitMQ is the internal message broker and is created as a single node.
RabbitMQ can be scaled out in a cluster configuration and fronted by a
load balancer to make it more highly available. The external load
balancer is used so that each application server can connect to a single
IP address or DNS name. To prevent the local RabbitMQ server creation
during setup set the configuration entry rabbitmq[‘enable’] = false and
use the three entries rabbitmq[‘host’], rabbitmq[‘port’], and
rabbitmq[‘stomp_port’] to the appropriate strings for the external load
balancer. The entry for the virtual host is rabbitmq[‘vhost’] and should
be set to / or root if no virtual host was created for the RabbitMQ
cluster. When using a load balancer fronting a RabbitMQ cluster the
heartbeat should be adjusted form the default of 580 seconds to
something just shorter than the connection timeout of the load balancer
using the entry rabbitmq[‘heartbeat’]. This prevents the connection
through the load balancer from closing and causing the associated
channels from closing as well in the message broker.</p>
<p>==== Search Index Tier</p>
<p>|morpheus| uses ElasticSearch to store data for searching, a default
instance is installed by the stand-alone installer. To provide
redundancy and scalability an external ElasticSearch cluster is needed.
To disable the creation of the internal ElasticSearch instance set the
configuration entry elasticsearch[‘enable’] = false. Provide the cluster
name of the external ElasitcSearch cluster using the configuration entry
elasticsearch[‘cluster’] and elasticsearch[‘es_hosts’] which is a Ruby
hash using hash rocket style syntax since the key contains dots. The key
is an IP address or DNS name with the paired value the port the database
is listening on.</p>
<p>NOTE: ElasticSearch v1.6 is currently supported.</p>
<p>==== Application Secrets</p>
<p>|morpheus| creates a secrets file at
/opt/morppheus/morphesu-secrets.json on the first run of the installer
configuration script. If the file exists, it will use the file and the
secrets contained. These entries are generated randomly and are unique
to each initial install. To synchronize access between application
servers each server needs to have the same secrets file. Depending on
the number of external components used, |morpheus| will use some or none
of the settings in this file. Secrets are still generated in case a
re-configuration after the initial setup requires a shared password for
a component.</p>
<p>==== SSL Certificates</p>
<p>The default mode for |morpheus| is to setup the web tier using
encryption to provide secure access to |morpheus| over Transport Layer
Security (TLS). |morpheus| will generate self-signed certificates if no
certificate is provided in the configuration file. To provide your own
certificate:</p>
<p>. Copy the private key and certificate to
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/etc/morpheus/ssl/your_fqdn_name.key</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/etc/morpheus/ssl/your_fqdn_name.crt</span></code> respectively.</p>
<p>. Edit the configuration file /etc/morpheus/morpheus.rb and add the
following entries:</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h1>.. code-block:: bash<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>nginx[‘ssl_certificate’] = ‘path to the certificate file’
nginx[‘ssl_server_key’] = ‘path to the server key file’ —-</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Both files should be owned by root and only readable by root.
If the server certificate is signed by an intermediate then you should
include the signing chain inside the certificate file.</p>
<p>In a distributed deployment, an external load balancer routes requests
to a pool of web/application servers. Depending on your infrastructure
setup the backend pool of servers can operate in TLS mode or non-TLS
mode which provides SSL offloading. To simplify the configuration, it is
possible to allow the load balancer to connect to each application
server using TLS. If your load balancer requires a certificate
validation with a known certificate authority, then you can import these
custom certificates as described in the previous paragraph. The other
option is to enable SSL offloading where the load balancer connects to
the application server pool over a non-TLS connection. To setup TLS
offloading in the |morpheus| configuration file set the appliance_url
to a URL that starts with http instead of https, this instructs the
configuration script to not generate the self-singed certificates.</p>
<p>NOTE: In the configuration file <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">appliance_url</span></code> does not have an equal
sign between the name and value.</p>
