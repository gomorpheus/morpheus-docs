Add a Google Cloud
------------------

.. TIP:: All of the required Goole Cloud credentials can be found in the .json file created when generating a key for a Google Cloud service account.

. Navigate to Infrastructure -> Clouds
. Select `+ CREATE CLOUD`, select Google Cloud, and then click Next.
. Enter the following into the Create Cloud modal:
Name:: Name of the Cloud in |morpheus| 
Location:: Description field for adding notes on the cloud, such as location.
Visibility:: For setting cloud permissions in a multi-tenant environment. Not applicable in single tenant environments.
Project ID:: Google Cloud Project ID
Private Key:: Service Account Private key, begging with `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\` and ending with `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`
Client Email:: Service Account Client Email. ex: `morpheus@morpheus.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
Region:: Regions will auto-populate upon successful authentication with the above credentials. Select appropriate region for this Cloud.
Inventory Existing Instances:: If enabled, existing Google Instances will be inventoried and appear as unmanaged Virtual Machines in |morpheus| .

NOTE: |morpheus| scopes clouds to single regions. Multiple clouds can be added for multi-region support, and then optionally added to the same group.

The Cloud can now be added to a Group or configured with additional Advanced options.

Finally, add Google Cloud to an existing Group or create a new Group, and you have now integrated |morpheus| with Google Cloud!
