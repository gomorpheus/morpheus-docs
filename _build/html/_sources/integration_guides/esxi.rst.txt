ESXi
====

IMPORTANT: The VMware ESXi integration is for adding a single ESXi / vSphere Hypervisor host. If you have vCenter please use the VMWare VCenter cloud type.

To get started with VMware ESXi, simply add a VMware ESXi Cloud in either the Infrastructure -> Clouds or Infrastructure -> Groups section.

. Select `+ Create Cloud` Button
. Select ESXi from the Add Cloud modal
. Select NEXT

You will then be taken to the configuration page. You will need to provide the configuration page the following  information.

* Cloud Name
* ESXi Host name or IP address
* Username ( This is normally root )
* Password

.. NOTE:: If you receive the message "Error! Invalid cloud config" Please ensure you have ssh enabled on the vSphere Hypervisor / ESXi. To do this please follow the these instructions on how to set-up ssh on vSphere Hypervisor / ESXi
