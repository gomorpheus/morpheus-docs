Active Directory
================

=== Overview

Active Directory is Microsoft’s primary authentication service widely used in Enterprise organizations and even via Microsoft’s cloud services. While Active Directory also supports LDAP protocol support (which |morpheus| can integrate with as well), the main Active Directory integration can also be utilized. It is even possible to map Active Directory groups to equivalent Roles within |morpheus| .

NOTE: To use Active Directory, a valid / trusted SSL certificate must be in place on the Active Directory services (self signed will not work).

=== Adding an Active Directory integration

. Navigate to `Administration -> Tenants`
. Select a Tenant
. Select Identity Sources
. Select + Identity Source
. Choose "Active Directory"
. Populate the following:

Name:: Unique name for authentication type.
AD Server:: Hostname or IP address of AD Server.
Domain:: Domain name of AD Domain.
Binding Username:: Service account username for bind user.
Binding Password:: Password for bind service account.
Required Group:: The AD group users must be in to have access (optional)
Default Role:: The default role a user is assigned if no group is listed under AD user that maps under Role Mappings section.
Service Account Holder:: This is the admin account type in |morpheus| and an AD group can be created and populated to a user that this role should be assigned. Roles are assigned dynamically based on group membership.

Now allowed AD users can login to |morpheus| via their Active Directory credentials and a User will be automatically generated to |morpheus| with matching metadata and mapped Role permissions.

NOTE: Only the username is required with password, not the username@domain.

NOTE: Sub-tenant |morpheus| API authentication for Active Directory generated users is not currently supported.
