Instance Details
----------------

The instance detail page is where you can view and fully manage an
instance. To get to an instance detail page, navigate to provisioning,
instances, and click on an instance. Please note instance details and
actions differ between instance types and user permissions.

There are several sections within an Instance page that provide useful
capabilities to the user.

-  Summary - Stats and status information
-  Deploy - Track deployment history for instance types that support
   deployments or manually kick off a deployment (only visible for
   instance types that support deployments)

   (i.e. mysql presents the my.ini)
-  Network - Useful for configuring security groups and access to the
   instance.
-  Monitoring - Quick summary of the monitoring system and all checks
   that were configured to test teh state of the instance
-  Backups - Quick backup dashboard. Useful for viewing historical
   backups as well as kicking off new ones.

   representing the instance.
-  Environment - View the environment variables presented to the
   instances or exported by the instances via Apps (more on this in the
   Apps section). Even see Imported environment variables that may be

   Easily configure auto scaling thresholds and load balancer settings
   that pertain to a particular instance.
