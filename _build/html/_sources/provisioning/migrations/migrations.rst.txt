Migrations
==========

Migration Types
---------------

Hypervisor to Hypervisor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Store
  |morpheus| will create a snapshot of existing VM and upload the snapshot to virtual image directory. Images that have been uploaded to the Virtual Images library can be converted to VHD, QCOW2, RAW and VMDK formats and then re-provisioned.

New
  |morpheus| will create a snapshot of an existing VM, convert from source format to required destination format, and then provision the VM into the target environment.

Source
  VMWare, Openstack, Xen, ESXi, Nutanix* Azure* Hyper-V* (
  *in-development)
Destination
  Softlayer, Openstack, Metapod, Xen, Amazon, VMWare, ESXi, Nutanix, Hyper-V Supported OS Type: Windows or Linux
Service Impact
  Disruptive Migration

Virtual Image Extract
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Virtual Image extract capabilities allow for a virtual image to be extracted and stored in the virtual image repository or the image can be migrated into a cloud.

Source
  Any Cloud
Destination
  SoftLayer (Only)
Supported OS Type
  Windows
Service Impact
  Non Disruptive
Requirements
  Requires a separate disk or network share to store the image during conversion process. Capacity of the disk or network share should be sized appropriately to support the data that will be exported.

Live Stream
^^^^^^^^^^^

Live Stream is a linux only streaming process that will take a snapshot of a volume and allow it to be streamed to a destination linux system that is either existing or new. The destination linux must already exist and it can either be a managed or unmanaged VM in |morpheus| . The destination will be overwritten from a root level perspective.

Source
  Any Cloud
Destination
  |morpheus| 
Supported OS Type
  Linux (Only)
Service Impact
  Non Disruptive
Requirements
  Requires the Linux host/guest to be configured for LVM and that free space of the capacity to be streamed is available. A destination linux host/guest must be available to receive the stream.
