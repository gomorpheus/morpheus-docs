CentOS
------

To get started installing |morpheus| on CentOS/RHEL a few preparatory items should be addressed first.

#. Configure firewalld to allow access from users on port 80 or 443 (Or remove it if not required).
#. Make sure the machine is self resolvable to its own hostname.

For RHEL: In order for the guacamole service (remote console) to properly install some additional optional repositories first need added.

-  **RHEL 7.x Amazon:**
   ``yum-config-manager --enable rhui-REGION-rhel-server-optional``
-  **RHEL 7.x:**
   ``yum-config-manager --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms``

For Amazon users a redhat subscription is not required if the appropriate yum REGION repository is added instead as demonstrated above.

.. IMPORTANT:: If the machine is unable to resolve its own hostname (``nslookup hostname``) some installation commands will be unable to verify service health during installation and fail.

#. Next simply download the relevant ``.rpm`` package for installation. This package can be acquired from your account rep or via a free trial
request from https://www.morpheushub.com.

.. TIP:: Use the ``wget`` command to directly download the package to your
appliance server. i.e. ``wget https://downloads.gomorpheus.com/path/to/package.rpm``

#. Next we must install the package onto the machine and configure the morpheus services:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo sudo rpm -i morpheus-appliance-x.x.x-1.x86\_64.rpm
  sudo morpheus-ctl reconfigure

#. Once the installation is complete the web interface will automatically start up. By default it will be resolvable at ``https://your_machine_name`` and in many cases this may not be resolvable from your browser. The url can be changed by editing ``/etc/morpheus/morpheus.rb`` and changing the value of ``appliance_url``. After this has been changed simply run :

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo morpheus-ctl reconfigure
  sudo morpheus-ctl stop morpheus-ui
  sudo morpheus-ctl start morpheus-ui

.. note:: The ``morpheus-ui`` can take 2-3 minutes to startup before it becomes available.

There are additional post install settings that can be viewed in the Advanced section of the guide.

Once the browser is pointed to the appliance a first time setup wizard will be presented. Please follow the on screen instructions by creating the master account. From there you will be presented with the license settings page where a license can be applied for use (if a license is required you may request one or purchase one by contacting your sales representative).

More details on setting up infrastructure can be found throughout this guide.

.. TIP:: If any issues occur it may be prudent to check the morpheus log for details at ``/var/log/morpheus/morpheus-ui/current``.
