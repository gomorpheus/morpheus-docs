== Requirements

|morpheus| is a software based appliance installation capable of orchestrating many clouds and hypervisors. Before an installation is started it is important to understand some of the base requirements.

In the simplest configuration |morpheus| simply needs one Appliance Server. The Appliance Server, by default, contains all the components necessary to orchestrate both vm's and containers. To get started some base requirements are recommended:

* **Operating System:** Ubuntu 14.04 / 16.04 (recommended) or CentOS/RHEL greater than 7.0.

NOTE: Please note Ubuntu 16.10 and Amazon Linux are not supported

* **Memory:** 8 GB minimum
* **Storage:** 50 GB storage minimum, 100+ GB recommended
* Network connectivity from your users to the appliance over TCP 443 (HTTPS)
* Inbound connectivity access from provisioned vm's and container hosts on ports 443 and 80 (needed for agent communication)
* Internet Connectivity from Appliance (To download from |morpheus| ' public docker repositories and virtual image catalog)
* Superuser privileges via the sudo command for the user installing the |morpheus| Appliance package.
* An Appliance URL that is accessible to all managed hosts. It is necessary for all hosts that are managed by |morpheus| to be able to communicate with the appliance server ip on port 443. This URL is configured under Admin->Settings. |morpheus| also utilizes SSH (Port 22) and Windows Remote Management (Port 5985) to initialize a server.
* An Appliance License is required for any operations involving provisioning.


=== Storage

|morpheus| needs storage space for a few items. One is for the built-in https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] store (used for log aggregation and stats collection metrics). |morpheus| also keeps a workspace and local virtual image cache for doing virtual image conversion and template upload. While the permanent store of these can be offloaded via a Storage Provider some space is still recommended for dealing with non streamable virtual image formats.

In many common scenarios it might be prudent to configure a shared datastore on a storage cluster and mounted to `/var/opt/morpheus` (this is where all user based data and database data is persisted). There are several folders located within here that can be independently located as desired.

=== Network Connectivity

|morpheus| primarily operates via communication with its agent that is installed on all managed vm's or docker hosts. This is a lightweight agent responsible for aggregating logs and stats and sending them back to the client with minimal network traffic overhead. It also is capable of processing instructions related to provisioning and deployments instigated by the appliance server.

The |morpheus| Agent exists for both linux and windows based platforms and opens NO ports on the guest operating system. Instead it makes an outbound SSL (https / wss) connection to the appliance server. This is what is known as the `appliance url` during configuration (in Admin->Settings). When the agent is started it automatically makes this connection and securely authenticates. Therefore, it is necessary for all vm's and docker based hosts that are managed by morpheus to be able to reach the appliance server ip on port 443.

|morpheus| also utilizes SSH (Port 22) and Windows Remote Management (Port 5985) to initialize a server. This includes sending remote command instructions to install the agent. It is actually possible for |morpheus| to operate without agent connectivity (though stats and logs will not function) and utilize SSH/WinRM to perform operations. Once the agent is installed and connections are established SSH/WinRM communication will stop. This is why an outbound requirement exists for the appliance server to be able to utilize port 22 and 5985.

NOTE: In newer versions of morpheus this outbound connectivity is not mandatory. The agent can be installed by hand or via `Guest Process` API's on cloud integrations like VMware.


=== Components

The Appliance Server automatically installs several components for the operation of |morpheus| . This includes:

* RabbitMQ (Messaging)
* MySQL (Logistical Data store)
* Elasticsearch (Logs / Metrics store)
* Redis (Cache store)
* Tomcat (|morpheus| Application)
* Nginx (Web frontend)
* Guacamole (Remote console service for clientless remote console)
* Check Server (Monitoring Agent for custom checks added via UI)

All of these are installed in an isolated way using chef zero to `/opt/morpheus`. It is also important to note these services can be offloaded to separate servers or clusters as desired. For details check the installation section and high availability.
