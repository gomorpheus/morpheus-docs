=== Debian / Ubuntu

To get started installing |morpheus| on Ubuntu (14.04 currently) a few prepratory items should be addressed first.

First make sure the apt repository is up to date by running `sudo apt-get update`. It might also be advisable to verify that the assigned hostname of the machine is self resolvable.

IMPORTANT: If the machine is unable to resolve its own hostname (`nslookup hostname`) some installation commands will be unable to verify service health during installation and fail.

Next simply download the relevant `.deb` package for installation. This package can be acquired from your account rep or via a free trial request from https://www.morpheusdata.com[morheusdata.com].

TIP: Use the `wget` command to directly download the package to your appliance server. i.e. `wget https://downloads.gomorpheus.com/path/to/package.deb`

Next we must install the package onto the machine and configure the morpheus services:

.. code-block:: bash
----
sudo dpkg -i morpheus-appliance_x.x.x-1.amd64.deb
sudo morpheus-ctl reconfigure
----

Once the installation is complete the web interface will automatically start up. By default it will be resolvable at `https://your_machine_name` and in many cases this may not be resolvable from your browser. The url can be changed by editing `/etc/morpheus/morpheus.rb` and changing the value of `appliance_url`. After this has been changed simply run:

.. code-block:: bash
----
sudo morpheus-ctl reconfigure
sudo morpheus-ctl stop morpheus-ui
sudo morpheus-ctl start morpheus-ui
----

NOTE: The `morpheus-ui` can take 2-3 minutes to startup before it becomes available.

There are additional post install settings that can be viewed in the Advanced section of the guide.

Once the browser is pointed to the appliance a first time setup wizard will be presented. Please follow the on screen instructions by creating the master account. From there you will be presented with the license settings page where a license can be applied for use (if a license is required you may request one or purchase one by contacting your sales representative).

More details on setting up infrastructure can be found throughout this guide.

TIP: If any issues occur it may be prudent to check the morpheus log for details at `/var/log/morpheus/morpheus-ui/current`.
