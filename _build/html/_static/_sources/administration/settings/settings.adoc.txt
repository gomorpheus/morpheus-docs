[[appliance_settings]]

== Appliance Settings

The `Administration -> Settings` section sets global configuration parameters for the Appliance, Tenant Registration, Email, Proxy and sets which Cloud types are enabled.

=== Appliance Settings

Host Level Firewall Enabled:: Enables or Disables the host level firewall. This must be Enabled to use |morpheus| Security Groups.
Appliance URL:: The default URL used for Agent install and Agent functionality. All Instances and Hosts must be able to resolve and reach this URL over 443 for successful agent install and communication.
NOTE:: Alternate Appliance URLs can be configured per Cloud in the `Edit Cloud -> Advanced Options` section.
Internal Appliance URL (PXE):: For PXE-Boot your appliance needs to be routable directly with minimal NAT masquerading. This allows one to override the default appliance url endpoint for use by the PXE Server. If this is unset, the default appliance url will be used instead.
API Allowed Origins: Specifies which origins are allowed to access the |morpheus| API.

=== Tenant Management Settings

Registration Enabled:: If enabled, the appliance login screen will have a "NEED AN ACCOUNT? SIGN UP HERE" link added, enabling new Tenant registration.
Default Tenant Role:: Sets the default Tenant Role applied to Tenants created from Tenant Registration.
Default User Role:: Sets the default User Role applied to the User created from a Tenant Registration.
