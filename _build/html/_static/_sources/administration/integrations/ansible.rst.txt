Ansible
-------

==== Overview

|morpheus| appliance supports Ansible integration for configuration management.  |morpheus| accomplishes this by integrating with an existing repository of playbooks as the master in a master-slave Ansible architecture.

To get started the only requirement is an existing repository for playbooks in a very simple structure.

==== Add Ansible Integration

. Navigate to `Administration -> Integrations` and select `+ New Integration`
. Select Integration Type "Ansible"
. Populate the following fields:
Name:: Name of the Ansible Integration in |morpheus| 
Enabled:: Enabled by default
Ansible Git URL:: https or git url format of the Ansible Git repo to use
Keypair:: For private Git repos, a keypair must be added to |morpheus| and the public key added to the git account.
Playbooks Path:: Path of the Playbooks relative to the Git url.
Roles Path:: Path of the Roles relative to the Git url.
Group Variable Path:: Path of the Group Variables relative to the Git url.
Host Variables Path:: Path of the Host Variables relative to the Git url.
. Save Changes

Once you have completed this section and saved your changes you can set up a Cloud or Group to utilize this integration.

==== Scope Ansible Integration to a Cloud

. Navigate to `Infrastructure -> Clouds`
. Edit the target Cloud
. Expand the `Advanced Options` section
. In the `Config Managment` dropdown, select the Ansible Integration.
. Save Changes

Once an Ansible integration is added to a Cloud, a new "ANSIBLE" tab will appear on the Cloud details page, populated with the Ansible integrations Playbook and Roles, as well as an editable Inventory list.

==== Scope Ansible Integration to a Group

. Navigate to `Infrastructure -> Groups`
. Edit the target Group
. Expand the `Advanced Options` section
. In the `Config Managment` dropdown, select the Ansible Integration.
. Save Changes

Once an Ansible integration is added to a Group, a new "ANSIBLE" tab will appear on the Group details page, populated with the Ansible integrations Playbook and Roles, as well as an editable Inventory list.

==== Provisioning Options

When provisioning Instances into a Cloud or Group with a Ansible Integration added, an `Ansible` section will appear in the Config section of the provisioning wizard. By default, Ansible is enabled, but can be disabled by expanding the `Ansible` section and unchecking `Enable Ansible`.

Ansible Integration Provisioning options:

Enable Ansible:: Select to bootstrap
Ansible Group:: Ansible Inventory Group. Use existing group or enter a new group name to create a new group. Leaving this field blank will place instance in the "unassigned" inventory group.
Playbook:: Playbook(s) to run. The .yml extension is optional.

==== Running Playbooks

Playbooks can also be ran on all inventory groups, individual groups, or added as a task and ran with workflows.

To run ansible on all or a single inventory group, in the Ansible tab of the |morpheus| Group page, select the `Actions` dropdown and click `Run`.

In the `Run Ansible` modal, you can then select all or an individual group, and then all or a single Playbook, as well as add custom tags.

Playbook's can also be added as tasks to workflows in the `Provisioning -> Automation` section, and then selected in the Automation pane during provisioning of new instances, when creating app templates, or ran on existing instances using the `Actions -> Run Workflow` on the Instance or Host pages.
