Options
=======

Options are user-defined custom inputs that are used throughout |morpheus|. Depending on the type of Input being created, users may need to create only an Input, or it might need to be paired with an Option List. Option Lists are static or dynamic lists of selections that would be associated with an Input if the user must make choices from a select list or typeahead field. This section discusses how to create different types of Inputs depending on the situation and powerful tools the user can take advantage of, such as dynamically filtered cascading inputs, logically generated Option Lists called from local or remote sources, and more.
