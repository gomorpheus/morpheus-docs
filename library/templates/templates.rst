Templates
=========

Templates can be created directly in |morpheus| and/or sourced from version control, depending on the type. They can be used to help users consume IaC technologies, generate configuration files, utilize scripts or store security scan packages. Once stored, they can be used with provisioned Instances, configured as part of Tasks or Workflows, or run regularly as part of security scan Jobs. Each section below discusses template types in greater detail.
