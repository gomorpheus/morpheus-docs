Overview
^^^^^^^^

There are many Task Types available, including scripts added directly, scripts and templates from the Library section, recipes, playbooks, salt states, puppet agent installs, and http (api) calls. Tasks are primarily created for use in Workflows, but a single Task can be executed on an existing instance via ``Actions > Run Task``.

Role Permissions
````````````````

The User Role Permission 'Provisioning: Tasks  FULL' is required to create, edit and delete tasks.

Tasks Types that can execute locally against the |morpheus| Appliance have an additional Role Permission: ``Tasks - Script Engines``. Script Engine Task Types will be hidden for users without ``Tasks - Script Engines`` role permissions.

Common Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When creating a Task, the required and optional inputs will vary significantly by the Task type. However, there are options which are common to Tasks of all types.

Target Options
``````````````

When creating a Task, users can select a target to perform the execution. Some Task types allow for any of the three execution targets listed below and some will limit the user to two or just one. The table in the next section lists the available execution targets for each Task type.

- **Resource:** An |morpheus|-managed Instance or server is selected to execute the Task
- **Local:** The Task is executed by the |morpheus| appliance node
- **Remote:** The user specifies a remote box which will execute the Task

Execute Options
```````````````

- **Retryable:** When marked, this Task can be configured to be retried in the event of failure
- **Retry Count:** The maximum number of times the Task will be retried when there is a failure
- **Retry Delay:** The length of time (in seconds) |morpheus| will wait to retry the Task
- **Allow Custom Config:** When marked, a text area is provided at Task execution time to allow the user to pass extra variables or specify extra configuration. See the next section for an example.

Allow Custom Config
```````````````````

When "Allow Custom Config" is marked on a Task, the user is shown a text area for custom configuration when the Task is executed manually from the Tasks List Page. If the Task is to be part of an Operational Workflow, mark the same box on the Workflow rather than on the Task to see the text area at execution time. This text area is inside the "Advanced Options" section, which must be expanded in order to reveal the text area. Within the text area, add a JSON map of key-value pairs which can be resolved within your automation scripts. This could be used to pass extra variables that aren't always needed in the script or for specifying extra configuration.

**Example JSON Map:**

.. code-block::

  {"key1": "value1",
  "key2": "value2",
  "os": "linux",
  "foo": "bar"}

When the Task is executed, these extra variables would be resolved where called into the script such as in the following simple BASH script example:

.. code-block:: bash

  echo "<%=customOptions.os%>"
  echo "<%=customOptions.foo%>"

The above example would result in the following output:

.. code-block::

  linux
  bar

- .. toggle-header:: :header: **Python Script**

See the information below for more detailed steps to install ``virtualenv`` on your |morpheus| appliance node(s).

    - **NAME:** Name of the Task
    - **CODE:** Unique code name for API, CLI, and variable references

    - **PYTHON BINARY:** Optional binary to override the default Python binary

    :raw-html:`<br />`

    Python and |morpheus|
    `````````````````````

    **Enterprise Proxy Considerations**

    Additional considerations must be made in enterprise proxy environments where Python Tasks are run with additional package download requirements. These additional packages are downloaded using ``pip`` and may not obey global |morpheus| proxy rules. To deal with this, create or edit the pip configuration file at ``/etc/pip.conf``. Your configuration should include something like the following:

    .. code-block:: bash

      [global]
      proxy = http://some-proxy-ip.com:8087

    For more information, review the Pip documentation on using proxy servers `here <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#using-a-proxy-server>`_.

    **CentOS 7 / Python 2.7 (RHEL system Python)**

    With a fresh install of |morpheus| on a default build of CentOS 7, Python Tasks will not function due to the missing requirement of ``virtualenv``.

    If you attempt to run a python task, you will get an error similar to the following:

    .. code-block:: bash

      Task Execution Failed on Attempt 1
      sudo: /tmp/py-8ae51ebf-749c-4354-b6e4-11ce541afad5/bin/python: command not found

    In order to run |morpheus| Python Tasks in CentOS 7, install ``virtualenv``: ``yum install python-virtualenv``

    If you require ``python3``, you can specify the binary to be used while building the virtual environment. In a default install, do the following: ``yum install python3``. Then, in your |morpheus| Python Task, specify the binary in the PYTHON BINARY field as "/bin/python3". This will build a virtual environment in ``/tmp`` using the ``python3`` binary, which is equivalent to making a virtual environment like so: ``virtualenv ~/venv -p /bin/python3``.

    If you wish to install additional Python packages into the virtual environment, put them in ``pip`` format and space-separated into the ADDITIONAL PACKAGES field on the Python Task. Use the help text below the field to ensure correct formatting.

    **CentOS 8 and Python**

    In CentOS 8, Python is not installed by default. There is a ``platform-python`` but that should not be used for anything in userland. The error message with a default install of CentOS 8 will be similar to this:

    .. code-block:: bash

      Task Execution Failed on Attempt 1
      sudo: /tmp/py-cffc9a8f-c40d-451d-956e-d6e9185ade33/bin/python: command not found

    The default ``virtualenv`` for CentOS 8 is the python3 variety, for |morpheus| to use Python Tasks, do the following: ``yum install python3-virtualenv``

    If Python2 is required, do the following: ``yum install python2`` and specify ``/bin/python2`` as the PYTHON BINARY in your |morpheus| Task.

    This will build a ``virtualenv`` in ``/tmp`` using the ``python2`` binary, which is equivalent to making a ``virtualenv`` like so: ``virtualenv ~/venv -p /bin/python2``

    If you wish to install additional Python packages into the virtual environment, put them in ``pip`` format and space-separated into the ADDITIONAL PACKAGES field on the Python Task. Use the help text below the field to ensure correct formatting.
