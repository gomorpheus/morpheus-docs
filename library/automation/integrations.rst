Integrations
------------

The Integrations section in |LibInt| is for adding and managing Automation Integrations. Existing Automation Integrations from |AdmInt| are also populated and accessible from |LibInt| and vice-versa.

``Provisioning: Automation Integrations`` and ``Admin: Integrations`` are separate Role permissions, so Automations Integration access can be separated from the Administration Integrations section.

Automation Integrations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - Ansible
 - Ansible Tower
 - Chef
 - Puppet

.. note:: Automation integrations can be added and managed in |AdmInt| as well. Adding and editing Integrations in |LibInt| and |AdmInt| are the same dataset and additions and updates are reflected in both sections.

.. note:: Role access for ``Integrations: Ansible`` determines user access to Ansible Integration detail page, which contains Ansible command line and execution access.
