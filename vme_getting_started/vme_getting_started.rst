Once deployed, take advantage of powerful features including live migration of VMs across cluster hosts with zero downtime, dynamically distribute workloads based on load, automatic failover of workloads following the loss of a host, and a lot more. Provisioning new workloads is also made easy with the |morpheus| image library, automation tools, and powerful provisioning wizard. In addition to |clusters|, |morpheus| also includes a deep integration into VMware vCenter, which also takes advantage of the same powerful provisioning wizard, automation engine, and monitoring capabilities.

This documentation covers the system requirements for |clusters| and a setup guide for installing |manager|. It also includes example use cases for effective use of the feature set and in-depth sections for each area of the UI and the capabilities of each tool.
