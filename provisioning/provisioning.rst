There are many capabilities in the |morpheus| provisioning engine ranging from virtual machines bound for VMware vCenter and |cluster| targets to containerized workloads targeting Docker. Deployment management and library template construction are also core aspects of the provisioning engine. This section of |morpheus| documentation covers the provisioning engine itself while the Library section covers template building, image management, and automation stacks.
