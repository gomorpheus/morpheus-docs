Repositories
------------

The :menuselection:`Provisioning --> Code --> Repositories` section contains the repositories integrated with |morpheus| allowing users to browse repository folders and files, view file contents from any branch, trigger a refresh, and create tasks, scripts and templates directly from the repos. This section also handles Import/Export functionality which allows users to backup |morpheus| items (Tasks, Library Items, etc.) as code in a repository which can also be imported into another appliance, if desired.

- Browse integrated repositories
- View repo files
- Switch branches
- Trigger repo refreshes
- Filter by Integration, Organization or Text search
- Create Custom Views
- Create Tasks from repo files
- Create Spec Templates from repo files

Onboarded Git repositories can be configured as either import or export targets for a |morpheus| appliance. This means that any created |morpheus| constructs, such as Tasks, Library Items, and others, can be backed up to an integrated Git repository as code. This backup can take place on an automatic schedule (syncs every four hours) or can be triggered manually after changes are made. Users can back up all supported constructs within the appliance to a single repository or use Labels to back up only selected items. Exported constructs can also be imported into target appliances. This is useful for sharing items between two |morpheus| environments, such as from a development appliance to a production appliance.

.. NOTE:: The use of this feature requires an integrated Git repository. Please see our `integration guide <https://docs.morpheusdata.com/en/latest/integration_guides/Deployments/deployment.html>`_ for Github or other Git integrations if you've not yet integrated your code repositories.

Supported Constructs:

- Tasks
- Workflows
- Spec Templates
- Library Items

Role Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Access and capabilities for the Import/Export feature set is determined by the following role permissions:

Role: Feature Access: ``Admin: Export/Import``
  - **None:** Cannot access the edit button on the Code List Page (|ProCod|) to set Import/Export settings or see Import/Export actions on the Code Repository Detail Page
  - **Full:** Code repositories can be edited to set Import/Export configurations and Import/Export actions can be viewed and used on Code Repository Detail Pages

Import/Export Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Code repositories are set to allow import, export or both from the Code Repositories List Page (|ProCod|). Click the edit button (|pencil|) to the right of the selected repository to edit its import/export settings. When editing a code repository for import and export, set the following configurations:

- **ENABLED:** When marked, routine syncs will take place between |morpheus| and this repository. This includes all file syncs and not just actions related to import and export
- **IMPORT/EXPORT:** Set "Auto export all" to automatically export once every four hours, "Manual export" to enable this repository for manual exports on demand, "Manual import" to enable this repository for manual imports on demand, "Import/Export" to enable both manual imports and exports on demand
- **PATH:** The path within the repository where |morpheus| should import from or export to
- **EXPORT LABEL FILTER:** Enter a Label and |morpheus| will export or import only constructs which include the Label into the repository. This must be a single Label, it cannot be a list of multiple Labels

Once you've configured the code repository, click :guilabel:`SAVE CHANGES`

.. NOTE:: Code repositories must have at least one file in them in order to export |morpheus| constructs as code. This can be as simple as a README file, they just cannot be empty.

Exporting
^^^^^^^^^

After a repository is configured to allow export (see previous section), it may perform periodic automatic refreshes or the user may need to refresh the repository on demand (depending on settings). To manually initiate an export, drill into the Repository Detail page, click :guilabel:`ACTIONS`, and click "Export All Resources".

.. IMAGE:: /images/provisioning/import/exportAll.png

Any new or updated constructs will be refreshed within the repository at the path your repository is configured to export into. Bear in mind that, even if you've configured |morpheus| to export only constructs categorized with a specific Label, any required dependencies would also be exported. For example, if you've labeled a Workflow to be exported, |morpheus| will also export the dependency Tasks so the Workflow will be functional. A similar behavior applies for exported Library Items which may have a number of dependencies. In the screenshot below, files can be seen populating the targeted Github repository.

.. IMAGE:: /images/provisioning/import/githubView.png

Importing
^^^^^^^^^

After |morpheus| constructs have been exported as code, they can be pulled down into other appliances which have the same repositories integrated. Items can be imported ad-hoc from the file browser within a Code Repository Detail page. Click on the gear (|gear|) dropdown to the right of any scribe file that may exist in your repository. For example, in the screenshot below, an individual Task is being imported into the destination appliance.

.. IMAGE:: /images/provisioning/import/importFile.png

In addition to importing one-off items, code repositories may also be configured for import so that many items can be imported at once. The same configurations can be made for import as export, including a specific path within the repository to import from and whether only specific Label groups should be targeted. Triggering a larger scale import for a whole repository is done from the Code Repository Detail Page. Click the :guilabel:`ACTIONS` button and then click "Import All Resources".

.. IMAGE:: /images/provisioning/import/importAll.png

Once the import has been initiated, |morpheus| will check to see if a new item will be created, if an existing item would be updated, if no action could be taken due to a conflict, or if no changes would result. This information is presented to the user who may then decide if the import action should go ahead.

.. IMAGE:: /images/provisioning/import/checkImport.png

.. IMPORTANT:: Care has been taken with |morpheus| Import/Export to ensure that existing work cannot be wiped out by an import action. For example, if a Task with a name identical to a pre-existing Task would try to be imported, |morpheus| will require the naming conflict be resolved before the import can take place. In fact, |morpheus| Import can only create new items or overwrite items created by import. It cannot overwrite anything user-created or anything pre-seeded with the system at install. Additionally, import cannot be scheduled automatically. Users must initiate all imports.

.. IMPORTANT:: Importing resources which rely on existing integrations or sensitive values will require some additional configuration on the destination appliance. For example, importing a Task which references code in a separate repository which is not integrated on the target appliance will be imported with reference to the missing integration. This integration would need to be added before the Task could be used. Another example scenario would be a Task which references a secret value held in |morpheus| Cypher. Once again, the Task would be imported and the required Cypher references would need to be made within the destination appliance before the Task could be used.
