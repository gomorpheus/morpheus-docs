Instances are a great starting point for taking advantage of self-service features and spinning up both VMs and containers. The top of the main Instances page shows overall statistics for the listed Instances, including count, status, and resource utilization. You can search for Instances by name, or filter by group, type, or category.

The Instance list contains important information about each Instance, including the Instance name, environment tag, type, IP address and port info, Instance version, the number of virtual machines or containers, the Group, and the associated Cloud.
