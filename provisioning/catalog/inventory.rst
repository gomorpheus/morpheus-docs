Order Detail
------------

.. image:: /images/provisioning/catalog/orderHistory.png

The Order Detail page includes a complete list of orders and some basic details about them. If the item still exists, you can link through to the detail page for the item (whether that be Instance detail, App detail, or Execution detail). When the item name is not hyperlinked, the item has been deleted but the record of the order remains in the history.
