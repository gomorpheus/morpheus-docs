KVM

Overview
^^^^^^^^

|morpheus| KVM is a powerful, cheaper alternative to virtualization compared with other hypervisor offerings. It is also very capable of setting up complex shared storage and multiple networks across many hosts. This guide goes over the process for onboarding brownfield KVM clusters. When onboarded, KVM clusters are associated with the chosen Cloud and can then be selected as provisioning targets using existing Instance types and automation routines. In this example, baremetal KVM hosts are added to a |morpheus|-type Cloud but similar combinations can be made with other Cloud types.

Requirements
````````````

When onboarding KVM clusters, the user must ensure the correct packages are installed. The required packages are listed below:

- kvm
- libvirt
- virt-manager
- virt-install
- qemu-kvm-rhev
- genisoimage

Additionally, |morpheus| will attempt to add a new network switch called 'morpheus' and storage pool when onboarding a brownfield KVM cluster. |morpheus| detects that virsh is installed and, when present, it will treat it as a brownfield KVM host. Brownfield KVM hosts must have:

- libvirt and virsh installed
- A pool called morpheus-images defined as an image cache and ideally separate from the main datastore
- A pool called morpheus-cloud-init defined which stores small disk images for bootup (this pool can be small)

.. NOTE:: |morpheus| uses a "morpheus-images" pool which is separate from the main datastore. This is a host-local image cache which facilitates faster clone operations. The cache will automatically purge images once the allocation reaches 80% to avoid filling completely. Once it is 80% full, the oldest accessed volumes in the cache will be deleted first until the cache is under 50% full once again.

Creating the Cloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|morpheus| doesn't include a KVM-specific Cloud type. Instead, other Cloud types (either pre-existing or newly created) are used and KVM clusters are associated with the Cloud when they are onboarded or created by |morpheus|. For example, a generic |morpheus|-type Cloud could be created to associate with baremetal KVM clusters. Similarly, brownfield VMware KVM hosts could be onboarded into an existing VMware vCenter Cloud. Other combinations are possible as well. In the example in this section, a |morpheus| Cloud will be created and KVM hosts will be associated with it to become |morpheus| provisioning targets.

A |morpheus|-type cloud is a generic Cloud construct that isn't designed to hook into a specific public or private cloud (such as VMware or Amazon AWS). Before onboarding an existing KVM host or creating one via |morpheus| UI tools, create the Cloud:

#. Navigate to |InfClo|
#. Click :guilabel:`+ ADD`
#. Select the |morpheus| Cloud type and click :guilabel:`NEXT`
#. On the Configure tab, provide:

    - **NAME:** A name for the new Cloud
    - **VISIBILITY:** Clouds with Public visibility will be accessible in other Tenants (if your appliance is configured for multitenancy)
    - **Automatically Power On VMs:** Mark this box for |morpheus| to handle the power state of VMs
    - **Inventory Existing Instances:** If marked, |morpheus| will automatically onboard VMs from any KVM hosts associated with this Cloud

#. On the Group tab, create a new Group or associate this Cloud with an existing Group. Click :guilabel:`NEXT`
#. After reviewing your configuration, click :guilabel:`COMPLETE`

Onboard an Existing KVM Cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Begin onboarding your KVM cluster from the Clusters list page (|InfClu|). Click :guilabel:`+ ADD CLUSTER` and select the option for "KVM CLUSTER". From the GROUP tab, select a Group containing the Cloud you wish to use, then click :guilabel:`NEXT`. From the NAME tab, select at least the Cloud and provide a name for the Cluster. The other options on this tab are optional and are for categorization and labeling purposes. After setting the name and Cloud, click :guilabel:`NEXT`

On the CONFIGURE tab, there is currently only one LAYOUT option, which is to bring in your brownfield external KVM Cluster. Provide a name and IP address for each host in the cluster. The name here is simply a friendly name for display in |morpheus| but often the hostname works well here. Use the plus (+) button to add as many additional host fields as you need. Moving on, you can update the default SSH port from the default of 22 if needed in your environment. Next, provide an SSH username and password, use a regular user with ``sudo`` access. Then, select a pre-existing SSH key stored in |morpheus|. For the CPU TYPE, currently only ``x86_64`` is supported and is pre-selected by default. Finally, for CPU model, we surface the entire database of model configurations from ``libvirt``. If unsure or if you donâ€™t know of a specific reason to choose one or the other, select ``host-model`` which is the default option. When finished, click :guilabel:`NEXT` and :guilabel:`COMPLETE`.

The new KVM Cluster will join the list of Clusters that may already exist on your Clusters list page. From here you can drill into the Cluster detail page for monitoring and day-two actions. Continue on to the next section for details on provisioning new workloads to your KVM Cluster.

Provisioning to KVM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the Cloud and hosts available, users can now provision to the KVM host using custom Instance Types and automation routines built in the |morpheus| library. To provision a new Instance, navigate to |ProIns| and click :guilabel:`+ ADD`. Select the Instance Type to provision, and click :guilabel:`NEXT`. Choose a Group that the KVM Cloud lives in and select the Cloud. Provide a name for the new Instance if a naming policy doesn't already give it a name under current configurations. Click :guilabel:`NEXT` to advance to the Configuration tab. The fields here will differ based on the Instance Type and Layout used but in the example case, selections have been made for:

- **Layout:** Single KVM VM
- **Resource Pool:** The selected KVM cluster
- **Volumes:** Configure the needed volumes and the associated datastore for each
- **Networks:** The KVM network the VM(s) should belong to
- **Host:** The selected host the VM(s) should be provisioned onto

Complete the remaining steps to the provisioning wizard and the new KVM Instance will be created.
