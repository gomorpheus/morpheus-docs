   .. include:: /integration_guides/Clouds/base_options.rst

   **Details**

   API URL
     vCloud Director API Url
      Example: ``https://org.vcd.company.com``
   USERNAME
     vCD Organization Administrator or System Administrator User

     - User must have an Organizational Administrator or System Administrator Role
     - Username must be in the format of <name>@<org>
     - When using a user with the System Administrator role, give the username in the format of <username>@system. Additionally, ensure this user has permission set correctly, such as to view objects created by the organization administrator if needed. Otherwise, things like catalogs and vApps created by the Organization Administrator might not be visible to |morpheus|
     - In some cases, it may not be advisable to use the system administrator user. This is because some environments will have API access turned off for the system administrator for security reasons as the user would be able to remove key pieces of infrastructure. If your system administrator user does have API access and you understand the risks, you can authenticate |morpheus| with this user

   PASSWORD
    Password for the user indicated above
   ORGANIZATION
    Select Organization. Dropdown populates upon successful authorization.
   VDC
    Select VDC. Dropdown populates upon successful authorization.
   API VERSION
    Example. ``31.0`` Note: Full version required. ``31`` would not be valid, must be xx.x (vCD API versions are strings)
   CATALOG
    Optionally select a vCD catalog to store |morpheus| artifacts or use the default "morpheus_auto" catalog
   Inventory Existing Instances
    If enabled, existing Virtual Machines will be inventoried and appear as unmanaged Virtual Machines in |morpheus| .

   .. NOTE: Multiple Organizations/VDC's can be added by creating additional Clouds in |morpheus|. Additionally, websockets need to be enabled on your load balancer when vCD has been deployed in a highly available configuration. The hypervisor console services use websockets. To enable websockets on your load balancer, please consult your load balancer documentation.

#. Select an existing or create a new Group to add the Cloud to. The Cloud can be added to additional Groups in a Groups `Clouds` tab.
#. Select :guilabel:`NEXT`
#. Review and then Select :guilabel:`COMPLETE`
