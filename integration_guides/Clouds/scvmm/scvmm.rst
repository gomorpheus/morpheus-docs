SCVMM
-----

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Access to SCVMM host on port 5985 for Agent installation
- Access to Hyper-V host on port 2179 for hypervisor console access
- |morpheus| Agent installation (installed on the target SCVMM host via port 5985 and WinRM)
- User with administrator privileges


Agent Requirement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SCVMM and Hyper-V integrations utilize the |morpheus| Agent for communication with the |morpheus| appliance, making the |morpheus| Agent required. This also means SCVMM and Hyper-V Clouds can only point to one |morpheus| Appliance at any given time. If another |morpheus| Appliance adds an SCVMM or Hyper-V Cloud thats is already managed by another |morpheus| Appliance, the |morpheus| Agent appliance_url will be updated to point to the new |morpheus| appliance_url, and the previous |morpheus| Appliance will no longer be able to communicate with the SCVMM Cloud or Hyper-V Cloud until the Agent configuration is updated to point to the previous appliance again. In |morpheus| version 4.2.1 and higher, multiple |morpheus| clouds can be created by integrating with the same SCVMM host. This allows users to create separate Clouds with are scoped to different SCVMM Cloud, Host and/or Cluster combinations.

.. NOTE:: |morpheus| only supports integration with standalone SCVMM installations and not high-availability cluster installation at this time.

Add a SCVMM Cloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Navigate to ``Infrastructure > Clouds``
#. Select :guilabel:`+ CREATE CLOUD`, select SCVMM, and then click :guilabel:`Next`.
#. Enter the following into the Create Cloud modal:

   .. NOTE::  You will need to open port 5985 in order for |morpheus| to communicate to SCVMM. You will also want to make sure the SCVMM Controller has WinRM enabled.

   **Details**


   SCVMM HOST
     IP address or URL of SCVMM host server
   USERNAME
     SCVMM Username, for example: svc.scvmm
   PASSWORD
     SCVMM user Password
   CLOUD
     To scope the SCVMM Integration to a single Cloud, select it from the Cloud dropdown, which populates after establishing communication and authorization over port 5985 using the supplied username and password. To scope to all Clouds, leave the dropdown selection as ``Select Cloud``
   HOST GROUP
     To scope the SCVMM Integration to a single host group, select a host group from the dropdown list. To scope to all host groups, select ``All Hosts``
   CLUSTER
    To scope the SCVMM Integration to a single cluster, select a cluster from the dropdown list. To scope to all host groups, select ``All``
   LIBRARY SHARE
     Select a Library Share to be used with the cloud integration
   SHARED CONTROLLER
     When creating additional |morpheus| clouds that point to an SCVMM host already integrated with this appliance, select the appropriate shared controller value from the dropdown.

     .. important:: Only set ``SHARED CONTROLLER`` on additional |morpheus| clouds and not on the Primary |morpheus| SCVMM cloud. Failure to set the ``SHARED CONTROLLER`` on secondary |morpheus| clouds pointed to the same SCVMM cluster will cause agent comm issues resulting in provisioning failures.

    WORKING PATH
      Path for |morpheus| to write to, for example ``c:\cloud``
    DISK PATH
      Path for Virtual Disks, for example ``c:\virtualdisks``
    HIDE HOST SELECTION FROM USERS
      Prevents host selection from appearing in provisioning wizards
    INVENTORY EXISTING INSTANCES
      Enable for |morpheus| to automatically discover existing VMs in the scoped resources
    ENABLE HYPERVISOR CONSOLE
      Enable to use VNC Hypervisor Console for |morpheus| console connection as opposed to the default SSH and RDP console connection methods. Requires resolution of all Hyper-V host names and access over port 443 from the |morpheus| appliance to Hyper-V hosts.
    
    **SCVMM Specific Advanced Options**
    
    INSTALL AGENT
      Enabled by default, INSTALL AGENT installs the |morpheus| agent on the scvmm Controller when adding the cloud, which is required for full functionally unless using a shared controller in which scenario the agent would already be installed on the scvmm controller node. Disabling INSTALL AGENT on the cloud config when not using a shared controller will remove the ability to provision to the cloud.

#. After clicking :guilabel:`NEXT`, the new Cloud can be added to a Group or configured with additional advanced options.
