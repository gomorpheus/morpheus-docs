Adding Infoblox Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

..

See Infoblox documentation for more information on user rights administration in that product.

   TENANT MATCH ATTRIBUTE
     This can be set to the name of the extended attribute in Infoblox where |morpheus| will check for the id of a morpheus tenant.  This allows for setting the tenantâ€™s |morpheus| id to an extended attribute field on a network view or network in Infoblox, and when the network or view is discovered by morpheus, it will be auto assigned to the right tenant.
   IP MODE
    Static IPs or DHCP Reservations
   EXTRA ATTRIBUTES
    Accepts a JSON input of custom attributes that can be saved on host records in Infoblox. These Must be first defined as extra attributes in Infoblox and values can be injected for the user creating the record and the date of assignment. The available injectable attributes are: `userId`, `username`, and `dateCreated`.

    .. code-block:: json

      {
        "Date Assigned":"<%=dateCreated%>",
        "Requestor":"<%=username%>",
        "Request Number":"<%=userId%>"
      }

Upon save the Infoblox IPAM integration will be created and the following will sync:

* Infoblox networks will be synced in and populate in the `Infrastructure - Network - IP Pools` tab and in the Infoblox detail page under the `NETWORK POOLS` tab

* Host Records will sync and populate in the Network Pool detail view (select an IP Pool name to view)

Adding IP Pools to Networks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|morpheus| can automatically assign the next available Infoblox IP in an IP/Network Pool and create the corresponding DNS records, as well as remove the records upon teardown. To enable this, add an Infoblox IP/Network Pool to the `Network Pool` section on a Network(s).

#. Navigate to `Infrastructure > Network > Networks`
#. Select a Network name and click :guilabel:`EDIT`
#. In the `NETWORK POOL` section, search for and select the name of the IP/Network Pool.

   * Gateway, DNS and CIDR must be populated for static/pool IP assignment
   * Select `Allow IP Override` to allow selecting between DHCP, Static entry and Pool Selection at provision time (if desired)
   * Deselect DHCP server if a DHCP server will not be used on the network (only static and/or IP Pool IP assignment)
