ArubaCX Network Integration
---------------------------

Overview
^^^^^^^^
The ArubaCX network plugin is implemented as a Morpheus GenericIntegrationProvider in Groovy. The plugin handles network and cluster events generated by Morpheus and modifies the configuration of Aruba CX switches based on the cable connections between the affected servers and switches.
|morpheus| integrates directly with ArubaCX to create or delete networks for OVS Port Groups that are added or deleted within a configured Cluster.

Features
^^^^^^^^

* Network - Create or Delete OVS Port Group.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- A pair of ArubaCX 8325 series switches.
- All the hosts part of the Cluster are connected to these pair of switches.
- REST API access to the ArubaCX switches with Administrative rights.
- User credentials for the ArubaCX switch pair with API access granted and read/write access to the switch configuration.

**Server Network Configuration (Netplan)**

#. On each host, configure a `bond0` interface on the management interfaces.
#. The management interfaces should be connected to the ArubaCX switch pair.

  **A sample configuration is shown below:**
  .. code-block::

      {
          bonds:
            bond0:
              interfaces:
                - ens2f0np0
                - ens1f0np0
              parameters:
                mode: "active-backup"
          ...
      }

**Switch Configuration**

#. Configure the management interface and IP address on both switches in the pair.
#. The switch pair must be configured with `vsx-sync` enabled for high availability and redundancy.

       **A sample configuration on the switch pair is shown below:**

        .. code-block::

            vsx
                inter-switch-link lag 256
                role primary
                keepalive peer 192.168.0.1 source 192.168.0.0
                vsx-sync loop-protect-global mclag-interfaces vsx-global

        .. code-block::

            vsx
                inter-switch-link lag 256
                role secondary
                keepalive peer 192.168.0.0 source 192.168.0.1
                vsx-sync loop-protect-global mclag-interfaces vsx-global

#. Create a Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group (MC-LAG) between the ArubaCX switch and the upstream network, referred to as `lag1`.
#. Configure the **lag1** interface on both switches in the pair.
  **A sample configuration on the switch pair is shown below:**

  .. code-block::
      interface lag 1 multi-chassis
          no shutdown
          no routing
          vlan trunk native 1
          vlan trunk allowed 1,175
          lacp mode active
          loop-protect

#. The switch ports connected to the serverâ€™s management interfaces should be set to `Trunk mode` with a `Native VLAN`.
  **A sample configuration is shown below:**

  .. code-block::
      interface 1/1/1
      no shutdown
      no routing
      vlan trunk native 175
      vlan trunk allowed 175

Adding ArubaCX Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Note:: Making full use of the Morpheus ArubaCX integration requires credentials for Aruba CX switch pair with API access granted and read/write access to switch configuration. See ArubaCX 8325 documentation for more information on user rights administration in that product.

#. Navigate to ``Administration > Integrations``
#. Select :guilabel:`+ New Integration` > Other > ArubaCX
#. Enter the following:
