Networks

`Infrastructure > Network > Networks`

Overview
^^^^^^^^

The Networks section is for configuring networks across all clouds in |morpheus|. Existing networks from Clouds added in |morpheus| will auto-populate in the Networks section.

Networks can be configured for DHCP or Static IP assignment, assigned IP pools, and configured for visibility and account assignment for multi-tenancy usage. Inactive Networks are unavailable for provisioning use. In addition, |morpheus| allows administrators to restrict management of |morpheus|-created Networks through Role permissions.

.. _networks_all_labels:

Filtering Networks by all Labels through the API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Networks API ``allLabels`` filter matches Networks that have every supplied Label. Supply the query key once for each Label; do not combine multiple Labels into one comma- or space-separated value.

.. code-block:: text

   GET /api/networks?allLabels=ENV.NIT&allLabels=SERVICE.LNX_AP_WLS

URL-encode Label values when they contain reserved characters. Repeated parameters are collected as separate values and the label service joins once per value, so the result contains only Networks matching all values. By contrast, ``labels``/``label`` uses match-any behavior.

Understanding Networks (VMware to |morpheus|)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For administrators coming from VMware environments, the following analogy table maps familiar VMware networking concepts to their |morpheus| equivalents:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 30 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - VMware Concept
     - |morpheus| Equivalent
     - Notes
   * - vSwitch / vDS (Distributed Switch)
     - Virtual Switch (HVM clusters)
     - Cluster-level abstraction that manages uplinks, bonds, and traffic types. See :doc:`/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/virtual_switches`.
   * - Port Group
     - Network
     - A named network with VLAN, CIDR, gateway, and DNS settings. VMs are attached to Networks during provisioning.
   * - VLAN ID (on port group)
     - VLAN ID (on Network or Virtual Switch segment)
     - VLAN tagging is set on the Network record or on the Virtual Switch traffic segment.
   * - VM Network / Management Network
     - VM Network traffic type (Virtual Switch)
     - The default Virtual Switch (``virtSwitch0``) carries VM traffic. Additional switches can be created for storage and migration.
   * - VMkernel adapter (vmk) for storage
     - Data (NFS) or Data (iSCSI) traffic type
     - Storage traffic is carried on dedicated Virtual Switch segments with host-level IP addresses assigned.
   * - VMkernel adapter for vMotion
     - Live Migration traffic type
     - Dedicated Virtual Switch segment for live migration traffic between hosts.
   * - IP Pool (IPAM)
     - IP Pool (|morpheus| or IPAM integration)
     - |morpheus| has built-in IP pool management or can integrate with external IPAM (Infoblox, Bluecat, etc.).
   * - Domain / DNS
     - Network Domain
     - Configured under Infrastructure > Network > Domains. Used for DNS suffix and Active Directory domain join.

Creating a New Network
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a new network and make it available for VM provisioning:

#. Navigate to ``Infrastructure > Network > Networks``
#. Click :guilabel:`+ Add`
#. Select the target Cloud where this network will be used
#. Configure the network settings:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 25 75
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Field
        - Description
      * - Name
        - Display name for the network (e.g., ``Production-VLAN100``)
      * - CIDR
        - Network CIDR notation (e.g., ``10.10.100.0/24``)
      * - Gateway
        - Default gateway IP for VMs on this network
      * - DNS Primary / Secondary
        - DNS servers for VMs on this network
      * - VLAN ID
        - VLAN tag (if applicable). Must match the VLAN configured on the physical switch / Virtual Switch.
      * - DHCP Server
        - Enable if a DHCP server is present on this network. When enabled, VMs receive IPs from DHCP rather than |morpheus| IP management.
      * - Network Pool
        - Select an IP Pool for static IP assignment. When a pool is assigned, IPs are automatically allocated from the pool during provisioning.
      * - Domain
        - Associate a Network Domain for DNS suffix and domain join
      * - Active
        - Must be enabled for the network to appear as a provisioning option

#. Configure permissions (Group Access, Tenant Permissions) as needed
#. Click :guilabel:`Save Changes`

.. tip::

   **Replicating a VMware network:** If you have a VMware port group on VLAN 100 with subnet 10.10.100.0/24 and gateway 10.10.100.1, create a Network in |morpheus| with those same settings. On an HVM cluster, ensure a Virtual Switch exists with a VM Network segment on VLAN 100 to carry this traffic on the physical uplinks.

Synced Networks vs Manually Created Networks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Synced networks** are automatically discovered from integrated Clouds (e.g., VMware port groups, AWS VPCs/subnets). These appear in the Networks list after a Cloud sync and can be edited to add |morpheus|-specific settings (IP pools, domains, permissions).
- **Manually created networks** are defined directly in |morpheus| and are used when the Cloud does not auto-discover networks (e.g., HVM clusters where networks are defined by Virtual Switch segments) or when you need to create an overlay network definition.

For the legacy/layout 1.3 **HVM Overlay Network** fields, VXLAN behavior, prerequisites, and deletion impact, use :doc:`/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/hvm_networks`. Do not apply that plugin workflow to layout 2.0 Virtual Switches.

Configuring Networks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

DHCP
````

To configure a network for DHCP:

1. Navigate to `Infrastructure > Network > Networks`
2. Search for the target network
3. Edit the Network by either:

   * Select `Actions > Edit`
   * Select the Network, then select `Edit`

4. In the Network Config modal, set the DHCP flag as Active (default)
5. Save Changes

.. IMPORTANT:: The DHCP flag tells |morpheus| this network has a DHCP server assigning IP Addresses to hosts. |morpheus| does not act as the DHCP server, and provisioning to a network that has the DHCP server flag active in |morpheus| , but no DHCP server actually on the network will in most cases cause the instance to not receive an IP address.

.. NOTE:: When selecting a network with DHCP enabled during provisioning, "DHCP" will populate to the right of the selected network:

Static and IP Pools
```````````````````

To configure a network for Static IP Assignment:

1. Navigate to `Infrastructure > Network > Networks`
2. Search for the target network
3. Edit the Network by either:

   * Select `Actions > Edit`
   * Select the Network, then select `Edit`

4. In the Network Config modal, add the following:

   * Gateway
   * DNS Primary
   * DNS Secondary
   * CIDR ex 10.10.10.0/22
   * VLAN ID (if necessary)
   * Network Pool
     * Leave as "choose a pool" for entering a static IP while provisioning
     * Select a Pool to use a pre-configured |morpheus| or IPAM Integration IP Pool

   * The Permissions settings are used for Multi-Tenant resource configuration

     * Leave settings as default if used in a single-tenant environment (only one Tenant in your |morpheus| appliance)
     * To share this network across all accounts in a multi-tenant environment, select the Master Tenant and set the Visibility to Public
     * To assign this network to be used by only one account in a multi-tenant environment, select the account and set visibility to Private

   * Active

     * Leave as enabled to use this network
     * Disable the active flag to remove this network from available network options

5. Save Changes

.. NOTE:: When selecting a network with DHCP disabled and no IP Pool assigned during provisioning, an IP entry field will populate to the right of the selected network(s):

.. NOTE:: When selecting a network with an IP Pool assigned during provisioning, the name of the IP pool will populate to the right of the selected network(s). IP Pools override DHCP.

Advanced Options (Search Domains)
```````````````````````````````

Search domains are appended to DNS searches when a **non** fully qualified domain name (short name) is queried.  Search domains can be entered as comma separated values, which will be added to DNS configurations, such as `/etc/resolv.conf`
These domains are injected via cloud-init or other method chosen for the virtual image.

Group and Tenant Access
```````````````````````

Networks can be configured to provide specific Group and Tenant access, if desired. **Group Access** controls which Groups at provision time will have access to the Network resource. Only workloads being provisioned to the selected Groups would have visibility into the Network. Workloads provisioned to other Groups would not see the Network as an available selection. **Tenant Permissions** control which Tenants may see the Network. Public visibility allows access to the Network for users in all Tenants (subject to additional RBAC controls) while Private visibility allows access only for selected Tenants. Select all that may apply.

Guest Console SSH Tunnel
````````````````````````

In some scenarios, instances that are segregated from the |morpheus| appliance by port restrictions, or other mechanisms, can cause difficulties to access the guest console via the |morpheus| web UI.
Guest Console SSH Tunnel settings allow the administrator to configure a jump host's settings that is dual-homed, accessible by |morpheus| but also resides on the segregated network.
When the guest console is configured with the SSH protocol, the traffic will be routed to the jump host, which will then relay to the target instance.

GUEST CONSOLE JUMP HOST
  DNS hostname or IP of the jump host to relay the traffic

GUEST CONSOLE JUMP PORT
  Port override, if different than 22 for SSH

GUEST CONSOLE JUMP USERNAME
  Username used to authenticate to the jump host

GUEST CONSOLE JUMP PASSWORD
  Password that is used with the username to autenticate to the jump host

GUEST CONSOLE KEYPAIR
  Keypair saved in |morpheus| to be used in lieu of, or in addition to, the password to the jump host, which is associated with the configured username
  Keypairs can be imported at: :menuselection:`Infrastructure --> Keys & Certs --> Key Pairs`

Subnets
```````

Subnet details can be viewed from the `SUBNETS` tab on the detail page of a specific network. From the `SUBNETS` tab, Morpheus allows the user to search and edit existing subnets.

In an Azure VNet, you can also create new subnets with the `+ADD` button.
