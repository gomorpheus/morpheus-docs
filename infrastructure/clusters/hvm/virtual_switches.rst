Virtual Switches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 9.1

.. important:: Virtual Switches are supported on HVM layout 2.0 with HVM OS 26.04. Legacy and layout 1.3 clusters use OVS networking; see :doc:`hvm_networks`.

Virtual Switch Overview
```````````````````````

A Virtual Switch is a cluster-level networking abstraction that simplifies host network configuration across layout 2.0 HVM compute nodes. Rather than manually configuring bridges, bonds, and VLANs on each host via CLI, Virtual Switches allow administrators to define network intent once and have it applied consistently across the entire cluster.

Virtual Switches manage:

- **Uplink selection** — Which physical NICs carry traffic
- **Bond creation** — Aggregating multiple NICs for redundancy or throughput
- **Traffic separation** — Isolating VM, storage, migration, and SDN traffic
- **VLAN handling** — Tagging traffic for network segmentation
- **IP addressing** — Assigning host-level IPs for storage and migration networks

Each layout 2.0 HVM cluster supports up to **8 Virtual Switches**. A default Virtual Switch named ``virtSwitch0`` is created automatically during cluster provisioning and handles VM network traffic.

Navigating to Virtual Switches
``````````````````````````````

To access Virtual Switches:

1. Navigate to :menuselection:`Infrastructure --> Clusters` and select your HVM cluster
2. Click the **Network** tab
3. Select the **Virtual Switches** sub-tab

The list view displays all Virtual Switches with their name, number of interfaces, and number of associated networks. From here you can add, edit, or delete Virtual Switches.

Traffic Types
`````````````

Each Virtual Switch carries one or more traffic types that define what kind of network communication flows through it. When creating a Virtual Switch, you select which traffic types it will handle.

.. image:: /images/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/virtual_switches/vs_add_select_type.png
   :alt: Add Virtual Switch - Select traffic type

The available traffic types are:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 50 30

   * - Traffic Type
     - Description
     - Use Case
   * - **VM Network**
     - Virtual machine network connectivity. Uses a VLAN-aware Linux bridge for VM-to-network communication.
     - Required for VMs to communicate with external networks
   * - **Data (NFS)**
     - NFS storage network for shared datastores. Supports bonding for redundancy and throughput.
     - Connecting hosts to NFS-based shared storage
   * - **Live Migration**
     - Dedicated network for live migrating VMs between hosts with minimal downtime.
     - Enabling live VM migration across cluster hosts
   * - **Data (iSCSI)**
     - iSCSI storage network. Uses a single interface (no bonding) to support multipath I/O.
     - Connecting hosts to iSCSI SAN storage
   * - **SDN**
     - Software-defined networking. Dedicated pathway for SDN control and data plane traffic.
     - Environments using SDN controllers (e.g., CN2)

Traffic Type Combination Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multiple traffic types can be combined on a single Virtual Switch, subject to the following rules:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 15 15 30 20

   * - Traffic Type
     - Bonding
     - Single NIC
     - Can Share With
     - Notes
   * - VM Network
     - Yes
     - Yes
     - Live Migration, Data (NFS)
     - Default Virtual Switch type
   * - Data (NFS)
     - Yes
     - Yes
     - VM Network, Live Migration
     - Supports bonds for throughput
   * - Live Migration
     - Yes
     - Yes
     - VM Network, Data (NFS)
     - Cannot share with iSCSI
   * - Data (iSCSI)
     - **No**
     - Yes
     - Cannot share with other data types
     - Single NIC enforced for multipath
   * - SDN
     - Yes
     - Yes
     - Cannot share with other types
     - Requires dedicated Virtual Switch

.. important::

   - **iSCSI** requires a dedicated Virtual Switch with a single NIC per host. Bonding is not supported because redundancy is provided by iSCSI multipath at the protocol level.
   - **SDN** requires its own dedicated Virtual Switch and cannot coexist with other traffic types.
   - **Data (NFS) and Live Migration** can optionally be split onto different networks (separate IP ranges) even when on the same Virtual Switch.

Combining Traffic Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can select multiple traffic types for a single Virtual Switch. When combining types, the wizard adapts:

- Selecting **VM Network + Data (NFS) + Live Migration** enables a 5-step wizard (Select Type → Configure → IPv4 Settings → Port Settings → Review).
- When both **Data (NFS)** and **Live Migration** are selected, a checkbox appears: *"Data (NFS) and Live Migration are on different networks"*. Enabling this allows you to assign separate IP ranges to each traffic type.

Virtual Switch Prerequisites
````````````````````````````

Before creating a Virtual Switch, ensure the following:

- **Physical NICs are cabled and up** on each host that will participate in the Virtual Switch.
- **Upstream switch ports are configured** for the desired mode (access/trunk, VLAN IDs, LACP if using Balance RR).
- **Consistent NIC naming** across hosts if using uniform uplinks, or identify per-host NIC names in advance.
- **MTU support end-to-end** — All devices in the network path (switches, routers, storage arrays) must support the configured MTU (especially 9000 for jumbo frames).
- **iSCSI multipath** should be configured at the OS/protocol layer if using iSCSI storage.

Adding a Virtual Switch
```````````````````````

Click **Add Virtual Switch** to launch the creation wizard. The wizard guides you through the following steps:

Step 1: Select Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Enter a **Name** for the Virtual Switch (maximum 12 characters)
2. Select one or more **traffic types** for this Virtual Switch
3. Click **Next**

.. note:: The Virtual Switch name is limited to 12 characters because it is used to derive the underlying Linux bridge name (name + ``-br`` suffix), which must fit within the Linux 15-character interface name limit.

.. tip:: The default ``virtSwitch0`` created during cluster provisioning can be renamed and edited, but it should not be deleted unless an alternative VM Network Virtual Switch is in place. At least one Virtual Switch with the VM Network traffic type must exist for VMs to have network connectivity.

Step 2: Configure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure the physical uplinks and bond mode for the Virtual Switch.

.. image:: /images/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/virtual_switches/vs_configure_uniform.png
   :alt: Configure step - Uniform uplinks with No Bonding

**Bond Mode**

Select how multiple NICs are aggregated:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Bond Mode
     - Description
   * - **No Bonding**
     - Single NIC per host. No redundancy at the link level. Maximum 1 NIC per host.
   * - **Active Backup**
     - One NIC active, one standby. Automatic failover if the active link fails. No switch-side configuration required.
   * - **Balance RR (LACP)**
     - Both NICs active with round-robin load balancing across links. The host bond uses ``balance-rr`` mode and requires **LACP (802.3ad) configuration on the upstream physical switch** to coordinate the link aggregation.

.. image:: /images/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/virtual_switches/vs_configure_bond_modes.png
   :alt: Bond mode dropdown showing available options

.. warning:: When using **Balance RR (LACP)**, ensure that the upstream physical switch ports are configured for LACP. Mismatched configurations will cause connectivity loss.

**Uplink NICs**

Choose how physical NICs are assigned to hosts:

- **Uniform uplinks (all hosts)** — The same NIC(s) are used across all hosts. Select from the available interfaces shown as green-tagged buttons.

  .. image:: /images/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/virtual_switches/vs_configure_uniform.png
     :alt: Uniform uplink selection

- **Set uplink NICs per host** — Different NICs can be selected for each individual host. This is useful when hosts have heterogeneous NIC naming or hardware configurations.

  .. image:: /images/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/virtual_switches/vs_configure_per_host.png
     :alt: Per-host uplink selection

.. tip:: Use **Set uplink NICs per host** when servers in the cluster have different NIC names (e.g., different hardware generations with different PCIe slot assignments).

**iSCSI Configuration**

When **Data (iSCSI)** is the selected traffic type, the configure step enforces specific constraints:

- Bond mode is locked to **No Bonding**
- Maximum **1 NIC** per host

This is because iSCSI relies on multipath I/O at the protocol layer for redundancy, not link-layer bonding.

.. image:: /images/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/virtual_switches/vs_configure_iscsi.png
   :alt: iSCSI configuration showing single interface constraint

Step 3: IPv4 Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure IP addressing for traffic types that require host-level IPs (Data and Live Migration networks). VM Network traffic does not require host IPs since VMs get their own addresses.

.. image:: /images/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/virtual_switches/vs_ipv4_settings.png
   :alt: IPv4 Settings with Data (NFS) and Live Migration on different networks

For each traffic type requiring IP configuration:

- **Start IP Address** — The first IP in the range to assign to hosts. Each host in the cluster receives the next sequential IP.
- **Subnet Mask** — Network subnet mask (e.g., ``255.255.255.0``)
- **Default Gateway** — Gateway for this traffic network
- **Auto Apply to Servers** — When enabled, the IP addresses are automatically distributed and applied to all current cluster hosts

When **Data (NFS) and Live Migration are on different networks**, separate IP configuration sections appear for each traffic type, allowing you to place them on different subnets.

.. image:: /images/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/virtual_switches/vs_ipv4_single_type.png
   :alt: IPv4 Settings for a single traffic type

**Switch to Advanced Mode** — Enables per-host IP assignment for scenarios where automatic sequential allocation is not appropriate.

Step 4: Port Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure VLAN tagging and MTU settings.

.. image:: /images/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/virtual_switches/vs_port_settings.png
   :alt: Port Settings with VLAN ID and MTU

- **VLAN ID per Traffic Type** — Optional VLAN tag (2–4094) applied to the traffic. When set, traffic is tagged with this VLAN ID on the physical uplink. Leave empty for untagged (native VLAN) traffic. VLAN 1 is reserved and cannot be specified.

  .. note:: When a VLAN ID is configured, the upstream physical switch ports must be configured as trunk ports that allow the specified VLAN(s). Omitting the VLAN ID means the traffic is sent untagged on the native VLAN of the switch port.

- **Global MTU** — Maximum Transmission Unit size for all interfaces in this Virtual Switch. Options:

  - **1500** — Standard MTU (default)
  - **9000** — Jumbo frames (recommended for storage and migration networks)

.. tip:: Use jumbo frames (MTU 9000) for Data (NFS), Data (iSCSI), and Live Migration traffic types to improve throughput and reduce CPU overhead. Ensure all network infrastructure (switches, routers) between hosts supports the configured MTU.

.. image:: /images/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/virtual_switches/vs_port_settings_single.png
   :alt: Port Settings for a single traffic type

Step 5: Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Review the complete Virtual Switch configuration before applying.

.. image:: /images/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/virtual_switches/vs_review.png
   :alt: Review step showing complete configuration summary

The review displays:

- **Name** — Virtual Switch name
- **Traffic Types** — Selected traffic types
- **Bond Mode** — Bond configuration
- **Uplink NICs** — Per-host NIC assignments

Click **Finish** to create the Virtual Switch. The configuration is applied to all hosts in the cluster.

Editing a Virtual Switch
````````````````````````

Click the edit icon (pencil) next to a Virtual Switch to modify its configuration. You can change:

- Uplink NICs (add/remove interfaces)
- Bond mode
- VLAN tags
- MTU settings
- IP addresses
- Traffic types

.. important:: Editing a Virtual Switch that is actively carrying traffic may cause a brief network interruption as the new configuration is applied across hosts. Specifically, changing uplinks, bond mode, MTU, or VLAN settings will temporarily disrupt traffic on the affected networks. Plan these changes during a maintenance window for production environments.

Deleting a Virtual Switch
`````````````````````````

Click the delete icon (trash) next to a Virtual Switch to remove it. A confirmation dialog appears before the deletion proceeds.

.. image:: /images/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/virtual_switches/vs_delete_confirm.png
   :alt: Delete Virtual Switch confirmation dialog

.. warning::

   - You cannot delete a Virtual Switch that has active VMs or networks attached to it.
   - Deleting a Virtual Switch removes all associated host networking configuration (bridges, bonds, VLANs) from every node in the cluster.
   - The default ``virtSwitch0`` should not be deleted unless you have an alternative VM network configured.

Virtual Switch Best Practices
`````````````````````````````

Network Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Separate traffic types for production environments.** Use dedicated Virtual Switches for VM, storage, and migration traffic to avoid contention and simplify troubleshooting.
- **Use at least 4 NICs per host** for proper traffic segregation:

  - 2 NICs (bonded) for VM Network
  - 2 NICs (bonded) for Data/Live Migration

- **If only 2 NICs are available**, you can combine VM Network + Data (NFS) + Live Migration on a single bonded Virtual Switch. Use VLANs to segregate traffic logically.

Bond Mode Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Active Backup** is recommended for most environments. It provides simple redundancy with no switch-side configuration required.
- **Balance RR (LACP)** provides higher aggregate throughput but requires LACP configuration on the upstream physical switch. Use this when bandwidth is critical (e.g., high-throughput NFS storage networks).
- **No Bonding** is appropriate for non-critical traffic or environments with limited NIC availability. Not recommended for production VM networks.

VLAN Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use VLANs to segregate different traffic types when they share the same physical uplinks.
- Ensure the upstream switch ports are configured as trunk ports carrying the required VLAN IDs.
- Document your VLAN assignments to avoid conflicts and simplify troubleshooting.

When to Use Tagged Bonds (VLAN-Tagged Bond Interfaces)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **tagged bond** is a bonded interface (two or more NICs) that carries multiple VLAN-tagged traffic types over the same physical link pair. This is the most common production design pattern for HVM clusters.

**Use tagged bonds when:**

- You have limited physical NICs (2–4 per host) but need to separate multiple traffic types (VM, storage, migration)
- You want link redundancy (bond) AND traffic isolation (VLANs) on the same physical uplinks
- You are replicating a VMware design where a single vSwitch with multiple port groups (each with a VLAN ID) carried different traffic types

**How it works in Virtual Switch:**

A single Virtual Switch with a bonded uplink (Active-Backup or LACP) can carry multiple traffic types, each on a separate VLAN. For example:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 15 60

   * - Traffic Type
     - VLAN ID
     - Description
   * - VM Network
     - 100
     - Guest VM traffic, tagged on VLAN 100
   * - Data (NFS)
     - 200
     - NFS storage traffic to storage array, tagged on VLAN 200
   * - Live Migration
     - 300
     - VM memory transfer during live migration, tagged on VLAN 300

In this design, the upstream physical switch ports must be configured as **trunk ports** allowing VLANs 100, 200, and 300. The bond provides link redundancy; the VLAN tags provide traffic isolation.

**VMware analogy:** This is equivalent to a VMware vSwitch with multiple port groups, each assigned a different VLAN ID, all sharing the same physical uplinks in a NIC team.

**When NOT to use tagged bonds:**

- If you have enough physical NICs to dedicate separate bonds to each traffic type (e.g., 8+ NICs per host), separate Virtual Switches without VLANs are simpler to troubleshoot
- If your physical switch infrastructure does not support VLAN trunking
- For iSCSI traffic that requires dedicated non-bonded NICs for multipath (use a separate iSCSI Virtual Switch instead)

MTU Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **VM Network**: Standard MTU (1500) is usually sufficient.
- **Data (NFS)**: Jumbo frames (9000) recommended for throughput.
- **Data (iSCSI)**: Jumbo frames (9000) recommended for throughput.
- **Live Migration**: Jumbo frames (9000) recommended to reduce migration time.
- **SDN**: Match your SDN controller requirements.

.. important:: All devices in the network path (host NICs, switches, routers, storage arrays) must support the configured MTU. A mismatch will cause packet fragmentation or drops.

Virtual Switch Limitations
``````````````````````````

- Maximum **8 Virtual Switches** per cluster.
- Virtual Switch names are limited to **12 characters**.
- Each Virtual Switch supports **1 or 2 uplink NICs** per host.
- **iSCSI** Virtual Switches are limited to a single NIC (no bonding) — multipath is handled at the protocol layer.
- **SDN** Virtual Switches cannot share uplinks with other traffic types.
- Bond mode changes on an active Virtual Switch may cause brief connectivity interruption.
- All hosts in the cluster must have the selected uplink NIC(s) available. When using **Uniform uplinks**, ensure consistent NIC naming across hosts. When using **Set uplink NICs per host**, each host must have its individually assigned NIC(s) available.

Virtual Switch Troubleshooting
``````````````````````````````

Virtual Switch Not Applying
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a Virtual Switch fails to apply to a host:

1. Check host connectivity from the cluster — ensure the host is reachable and the Morpheus agent is running.
2. Review ``/var/log/hvmcli/`` on the affected host for detailed error messages.
3. Verify the selected uplink NICs exist and are up on the host.
4. Check that no conflicting network configuration exists in ``/etc/netplan/``.

LACP Bond Not Working
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Verify that LACP is configured on the upstream physical switch ports.
- Ensure both switch and host are using the same LACP mode (802.3ad).
- Check that both uplink NICs have physical link (green LED or ``ip link show`` state UP).

VM Network Connectivity Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Verify the Virtual Switch bridge is up: check ``ip link show`` on the host for the bridge device (``<name>-br``).
- If using VLANs, confirm the upstream switch trunk port carries the configured VLAN.
- Check that libvirt network is active: ``virsh net-list`` should show the Virtual Switch network as active.

Storage Network Unreachable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Verify the IP was correctly assigned to the host interface.
- Check that the storage array or NFS server is on the same subnet or reachable via the configured gateway.
- For iSCSI, verify multipath is configured correctly at the OS level.
