Identity Sources
================
|AdmTen| > (Selected Tenant) > Identity Sources
|AdmUse| > Identity Sources

Overview
--------

|morpheus| can integrate with many of the most common identity source technologies, such as Active Directory, Okta, and many others. These can be configured via the :guilabel:`Identity Sources` button on any Tenant detail page (|AdmTen| > Selected Tenant) or on the Users list page (|AdmUse|). These integrations map roles within these sign-on tools to equivalent roles in |morpheus| so at first log in users are assigned the appropriate role.
