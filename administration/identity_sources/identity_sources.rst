Overview
--------

|morpheus| can integrate with many of the most common identity source technologies, such as Active Directory, Okta, and many others. These can be configured via the :guilabel:`Identity Sources` button on the Users list page (|AdmUse|). These integrations map roles within these sign-on tools to equivalent roles in |morpheus| so at first log in users are assigned the appropriate role.
