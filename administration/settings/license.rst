Overview
^^^^^^^^

|morpheus| requires a valid license for provisioning new Instances, Apps and Hosts, and converting existing Instances and Hosts to managed. Licenses can be applied and updated in this section, and the current license status can be checked.

Current License
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a License Key has already been applied, the License status is shown in the `Current License` section:

Tenant Name
  Company name the License was generated for.
Start Date
  Date and time the current License started.
End Date
  Date and time the current License expires.
Space
  Amount of used and unused Managed RAM under the current License.

EXAMPLE: On a 1 TB License with 182 GB of RAM under management, the Space section will show `Used Space 182.9GB  Unused Space 841.0GB`

.. NOTE:: Once a current License expires or has reached its Space limit, users will no longer be able to provision new Instances, Apps, Hosts, or Bare Metal, or convert existing Hosts, Virtual Machines, or Bare Metal to managed. Morpheus will otherwise continue to function.

Upgrade License Key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a new or update an existing License:

#. Copy the License Key into the License Key field
#. Click `UPDATE`

If valid, the new License will be applied.
