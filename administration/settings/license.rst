Overview
^^^^^^^^

|morpheus| requires a valid license for provisioning new Instances, Apps and Hosts, and converting existing Instances and Hosts to managed. Licenses can be applied and updated in this section, and the current license status can be checked.

.. NOTE:: |morpheus| is licensed for a certain number of concurrent workload elements (WLEs) that may be managed or inventoried at any one time. See our `Knowledge Base <https://support.morpheusdata.com/s/article/What-is-a-Workload-Element-or-WE-for-purposes-of-Morpheus-licensing?language=en_US>`_ for specific information on the types of WLEs that count against |morpheus| licensing.

Current License
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a License Key has already been applied, the License status is shown in the `Current License` section:

Tenant Name
  Company name the License was generated for
Product Tier
  The type of license applied to this appliance, such as "Enterprise" for a typical paid license or "Community" for free Community-tier appliances
Start Date
  Date and time the current License started
End Date
  Date and time the current License expires

.. NOTE:: Once a current License expires or has reached its workload limit, users will no longer be able to provision new Instances, Apps, Hosts, or Bare Metal, or convert existing Hosts, Virtual Machines, or Bare Metal to managed. |morpheus| will otherwise continue to function.

Upgrade License Key
