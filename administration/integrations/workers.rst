Distributed Workers
-------------------

Overview
^^^^^^^^

The |morpheus| Worker is a separately deployed service that can proxy Cloud and Agent traffic, route console and VDI sessions, and act as a quorum witness for supported HVM clusters. A single Worker runtime can provide more than one capability, but each capability uses a specific registration and key in |morpheus|.

Distributed Workers, including Workers used as HVM quorum witnesses, are available in VM Essentials, Advanced, and Enterprise. The VDI Gateway use case requires an Advanced or Enterprise license.

   * - Capability
     - Registration
     - Worker configuration
     - Assignment and traffic path
   * - Cloud API proxy and Agent relay
     - Distributed Worker in |AdmIntDis|
     - ``worker['worker_key']``
     - Select the Worker on a supported Cloud. The Worker opens an outbound connection to the |morpheus| appliance and relays traffic to resources it can reach.
   * - Console gateway
     - VDI Gateway in |TooVDIGat|
     - ``worker['apikey']``
     - Select the gateway on a Network, Cloud, or as Default Console Gateway in |AdmSetApp|. Browser console traffic is redirected to the gateway.
   * - VDI gateway
     - VDI Gateway in |TooVDIGat|
     - ``worker['apikey']``
     - Assign the gateway to a VDI Pool. User desktop sessions for that Pool are redirected to the gateway.
   * - HVM quorum witness
     - Distributed Worker in |AdmIntDis|
     - ``worker['worker_key']`` and a reachable Worker URL
     - Select the Worker as the cluster witness. Cluster Hosts contact the Worker URL for quorum arbitration. For two-Host GFS2 with no Site Groups, see :doc:`/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/two_node_clusters`. For stretch clusters with Site Groups, see :doc:`/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/stretch_clusters`.

The gateway API key and Distributed Worker key are independent. Configure only ``worker['worker_key']`` for Distributed Worker and witness use, only ``worker['apikey']`` for console and VDI gateway use, or both keys to enable combined roles on one runtime. A console gateway is not a separate runtime mode; it is a VDI Gateway registration selected for console routing.

Use separate Worker deployments when gateway sessions, Cloud proxy traffic, and quorum witness traffic require different network zones, independent maintenance windows, fault isolation, or capacity scaling. If roles are combined, the Worker URL, certificates, firewall rules, and availability design must satisfy every enabled role.

**Supported Cloud Types**

The following Cloud/Zone types have established Distributed Worker Cloud API proxy and Agent relay support:

- vmware
- vmwareCloudAws
- nutanix
- openstack
- xenserver
- macstadium
- hvm
- scvmm
- hyperv

HVM, SCVMM, and Hyper-V clouds can be managed remotely through Distributed Workers. When a Worker is assigned to an HVM, SCVMM, or Hyper-V Cloud, Cloud API traffic and Agent relay communication are proxied through the Worker. Note the following:

- An HVM appliance image based on Ubuntu 24.04 is available beginning with |morpheus| 8.0.6.
- A Distributed Worker can also serve as an HVM quorum witness beginning with |morpheus| 9.0. Witness traffic is a separate cluster quorum role in addition to Cloud API proxy support.
- For SCVMM and Hyper-V, the Worker proxies WinRM-based API calls and Agent relay traffic to the SCVMM controller host.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A distributed worker VM is installed and configured similarly to a |morpheus| appliance via ``rpm`` or ``deb`` package.

.. NOTE:: Package URLs for the distributed worker are available at https://app.morpheushub.com in the downloads section.

.. NOTE:: The distributed worker requires that the |morpheus| appliance has a trusted SSL certificate.  This can be accomplished by configuring a public trusted SSL certificate on the |morpheus| appliance (or load balancer) or ensure the certificate and chain are added to the Java Keystore of the Distributed Worker to trust the certificate.

**Requirements**

     - 18.04, 20.04, 22.04

.. NOTE:: Ubuntu 24.04 package support for a directly installed Distributed Worker is not established by the available package policy and is therefore not listed. The Worker container has its own Alpine-based runtime; this does not establish a supported Ubuntu 24.04 host combination. Use only a release-approved package or container deployment.

- **Memory:** 4 GB RAM minimum recommended
- **Storage:** 10 GB storage minimum recommended. Storage is required for installation packages and log files
- **CPU:** 4-core minimum recommended
- Network connectivity **to** the |morpheus| appliance over TCP 443 (HTTPS)
- Inbound connectivity from browsers when the Worker is used as a console or VDI gateway
- Inbound connectivity from every participating HVM Host when the Worker is used as a witness
- Superuser privileges via the ``sudo`` command for the user installing the |morpheus| worker package
- Access to base ``yum`` or ``apt`` repos. Access to Optional RPM repos may be required for RPM distros

.. IMPORTANT:: In order to proxy VMware vCenter Cloud traffic through a Distributed Worker, you must have a static public DNS entry for the internal IP address of the vCenter appliance. If this is not done, everything may appear to be working properly when configuring the Cloud but problems will arise at provision time. This is not a |morpheus| limitation but is a limitation of the VMware SDK client which does not natively support proxies.

Download the appropriate package from |morpheus| Hub based on your target Linux distribution and version for installation in a directory of your choosing. The package can be removed after successful installation.

.. code-block:: bash

   wget https://downloads.morpheusdata.com/path/to/morpheus-worker-$version.distro

Validate the package checksum as compared with the values indicated on Hub. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   sha256sum morpheus-worker-$version.distro

Next, install the package using your selected distribution's package installation command and your preferred options. Example, for RPM:

**rpm**:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo rpm -ihv morpheus-worker-$version.$distro

   Thank you for installing Morpheus Worker!
   Configure and start the Worker by running the following command:

   sudo morpheus-worker-ctl reconfigure

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the package installed, we need to add a new distributed worker in |morpheus| UI. Distributed workers are added in |AdmIntDis|. To create one, populate the following fields:

- **NAME:** A name for the distributed worker in |morpheus|
- **DESCRIPTION:** An optional description for the distributed worker
- **PROXY HOSTS:** A comma-delimited list of global proxy hosts, any endpoint listed here will be proxied through the |morpheus| worker. For VMware, you must list the host addresses for any vCenter you wish to proxy through the worker. Xen hosts and PowerVC hosts must be listed here as well. Other Cloud types which are supported by the |morpheus| worker need only have the worker configured on the Edit Cloud modal (|InfClo| > Selected Cloud > Edit button)
- **ENABLED:** When marked, the selected worker is available for use

.. IMPORTANT:: The proxy host URL entered in the Worker configuration must match the URL set in the Cloud configuration. That is, if you use the URL in the Cloud configuration you must also use it in the Worker configuration. The reverse is also true, if an IP address is used in the Cloud configuration, that should be used in the Worker configuration as well. There are also configuration considerations that must be made for proxying vCenter Cloud traffic through a Distributed Worker. See the "IMPORTANT" box in the "Requirements" section for additional details.

After clicking :guilabel:`SAVE CHANGES`, an API key is generated and displayed. Make note of this as it will be needed in a later configuration step.

.. image:: /images/worker/createWorker.png

With the worker configured in |morpheus|, the next step is to update supported Cloud integrations which should be proxied through the worker. Select the desired Cloud from the Clouds List Page (|InfClo|) and click :guilabel:`EDIT` from the chosen Cloud's Detail Page. Within the Connection Options section, choose a configured worker from the WORKER dropdown menu. Click :guilabel:`SAVE CHANGES`.

.. image:: /images/worker/addWorkerToCloud.png
  :width: 50%

With the API key in hand and configuration complete in |morpheus| UI, head back to the worker box. Configure the gateway by editing ``/etc/morpheus/morpheus-worker.rb`` and updating the following:

**Distributed Worker or witness only:**

   .. code-block:: rb

       worker_url = 'https://worker.example.com'
       worker['appliance_url'] = 'https://morpheus.example.com'
       worker['worker_key'] = 'DISTRIBUTED WORKER KEY'

**Console or VDI gateway only:**

   .. code-block:: rb

       worker_url = 'https://worker.example.com'
       worker['appliance_url'] = 'https://morpheus.example.com'
       worker['apikey'] = 'VDI GATEWAY API KEY'

**Combined Distributed Worker and gateway roles:**

   .. code-block:: rb

       worker_url = 'https://worker.example.com' # URL used to reach this Worker
       worker['appliance_url'] = 'https://morpheus_appliance_url' # The resolvable URL or IP address of Morpheus appliance which the worker can reach on port 443
       worker['apikey'] = 'VDI GATEWAY API KEY'
       worker['worker_key'] = 'DISTRIBUTED WORKER KEY' # Distributed Worker API Key from Administration > Integrations > Distributed Workers configuration
       worker['proxy_address'] = 'http://proxy.address:1234' # For environments in which the worker must go through a proxy to communicate with the Morpheus appliance or other resources, configure the address
       worker['no_proxy'] = 'vcenter.example.com,192.168.xx.xx' # A comma-separated list of resources that should be accessed directly and not through the proxy

.. NOTE:: ``worker_url`` identifies the Worker service. ``worker['appliance_url']`` identifies the |morpheus| appliance. Do not interchange them. By default, ``worker_url`` uses the Worker's hostname. For gateway or witness use, set it to a stable URL that every required client can resolve, reach, and trust.

After all configuration options have been set, run ``sudo morpheus-worker-ctl reconfigure`` to install and configure the worker, nginx and guacd services:

   .. code-block:: bash

     sudo morpheus-worker-ctl reconfigure

The worker reconfigure process will install and configure the worker, nginx and guacd services and dependencies.

.. TIP:: If the reconfigure process fails due to a missing dependency, add the repo that the missing dependency can be found in and run

.. NOTE:: Configuration options can be updated after the initial reconfigure by editing ``/etc/morpheus/morpheus-worker.rb`` and running ``sudo morpheus-worker-ctl reconfigure`` again.

Once the installation is complete the morpheus worker service will automatically start and open a web socket with the specified |morpheus| appliance. To monitor the startup process, run ``morpheus-worker-ctl tail`` to tail the logs of the worker, nginx and guacd services. Individual services can be tailed by specifying the service, for example ``morpheus-worker-ctl tail worker``

Verify package service health before assigning traffic:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo morpheus-worker-ctl status
   sudo morpheus-worker-ctl tail worker

Container Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Worker is also published as the `morpheusdata/morpheus-worker <https://hub.docker.com/r/morpheusdata/morpheus-worker>`_ container image. Use a version tag approved for the |morpheus| Manager release. Do not use ``latest`` for production because it can point to a different product version. The examples below use the confirmed ``9.0.2`` tag; replace it when deploying with another supported Manager release. During Docker Hub maintenance, a valid tag may temporarily be absent from the web or API tag listing.

The image exposes HTTP on port 8080 and HTTPS on port 8443. The following variables configure its roles:

.. list-table:: Worker container environment variables
   :widths: 28 18 54
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Variable
     - Required
     - Purpose
   * - ``MORPHEUS_URL``
     - Yes
     - URL of the |morpheus| appliance that the Worker connects to.
   * - ``MORPHEUS_WORKER_KEY``
     - For Distributed Worker or witness roles
     - API key generated by the Distributed Worker record in |AdmIntDis|.
   * - ``MORPHEUS_KEY``
     - For console or VDI gateway roles
     - API key generated by the VDI Gateway record in |TooVDIGat|. Omit it for Worker-only deployments.
   * - ``MORPHEUS_SELF_SIGNED``
     - No
     - Set to ``true`` to generate a self-signed HTTPS listener for testing. Use a trusted certificate or terminate TLS at a trusted load balancer in production.
   * - ``MORPHEUS_SSL_ALIAS`` and ``MORPHEUS_SSL_PASSWORD``
     - With PKCS#12 TLS
     - Alias and password for ``/etc/certs/cert.p12`` mounted into the container.
   * - ``https_proxy``
     - No
     - Outbound HTTPS proxy used by the Worker's HTTP client.

Set ``WORKER_IMAGE_TAG`` to the approved tag before running these examples:

.. code-block:: bash

   export WORKER_IMAGE_TAG=9.0.2

**Distributed Worker only:**

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run -d --name morpheus-worker \
     -p 8080:8080 \
     -e MORPHEUS_URL=https://morpheus.example.com \
     -e MORPHEUS_WORKER_KEY=<distributed-worker-key> \
     morpheusdata/morpheus-worker:${WORKER_IMAGE_TAG}

A witness also uses ``MORPHEUS_WORKER_KEY``, but it must publish a trusted endpoint reachable from every participating Host. Use the production HTTPS example below for a witness container.

**Console or VDI gateway only with a test self-signed listener:**

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run -d --name morpheus-worker \
     -p 8443:8443 \
     -e MORPHEUS_URL=https://morpheus.example.com \
     -e MORPHEUS_KEY=<vdi-gateway-key> \
     -e MORPHEUS_SELF_SIGNED=true \
     morpheusdata/morpheus-worker:${WORKER_IMAGE_TAG}

**Combined Distributed Worker and gateway roles:**

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run -d --name morpheus-worker \
     -p 8443:8443 \
     -e MORPHEUS_URL=https://morpheus.example.com \
     -e MORPHEUS_WORKER_KEY=<distributed-worker-key> \
     -e MORPHEUS_KEY=<vdi-gateway-key> \
     -e MORPHEUS_SELF_SIGNED=true \
     morpheusdata/morpheus-worker:${WORKER_IMAGE_TAG}

For production HTTPS or witness use, mount a PKCS#12 certificate and omit ``MORPHEUS_SELF_SIGNED``:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run -d --name morpheus-worker \
     -p 8443:8443 \
     -v /secure/path/cert.p12:/etc/certs/cert.p12:ro \
     -e MORPHEUS_URL=https://morpheus.example.com \
     -e MORPHEUS_WORKER_KEY=<distributed-worker-key> \
     -e MORPHEUS_SSL_ALIAS=<certificate-alias> \
     -e MORPHEUS_SSL_PASSWORD=<certificate-password> \
     morpheusdata/morpheus-worker:${WORKER_IMAGE_TAG}

After startup, verify that the container is running and healthy, that the configured Worker or gateway appears active in |morpheus|, and that clients for each enabled role can reach the published URL:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker ps --filter name=morpheus-worker
   docker inspect --format '{{.State.Health.Status}}' morpheus-worker
   docker logs morpheus-worker

The image health check verifies the bundled Guacamole service. Also validate the |morpheus| registration and the end-to-end traffic path for each enabled role. Upgrade by validating a new release-compatible tag, recreating the container with the same registration keys and certificate configuration, and repeating the role-specific checks.

Witness Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Distributed Worker can provide quorum witness services for HVM 1.3 or later clusters using an HPE Shared File System (GFS2) datastore. This includes two-node GFS2 clusters and stretch clusters with site groups. For the complete two-node topology, deployment order, validation, failure behavior, and limitations, see :doc:`/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/two_node_clusters`.

The **Worker URL** on the Distributed Worker record is mandatory for witness use. |morpheus| uses this value to construct the ``witnessUrl`` sent to each cluster Host. Every participating Host must be able to resolve the URL, route to the Worker listener, and trust its TLS certificate. The Worker's outbound connection to the |morpheus| appliance does not prove that Hosts can reach the witness.

Before assigning a witness:

#. Create the Distributed Worker record in |AdmIntDis| and set **Worker URL** to the stable client-facing URL for the Worker.
#. Configure the runtime with the record's ``worker_key`` or ``MORPHEUS_WORKER_KEY``.
#. Verify that the Worker shows as active in |morpheus|.
#. From every cluster Host, resolve the Worker URL and make an HTTPS connection to it. A successful TLS connection or HTTP response confirms the path; do not disable certificate validation in production.
#. Ensure firewalls and load balancers preserve the witness path and do not require interactive authentication.

For cluster assignment and quorum validation:

- Two-Host GFS2 with no Site Groups: :doc:`/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/two_node_clusters`
- Site Groups / multi-site stretch: :doc:`/infrastructure/clusters/hvm/stretch_clusters`

Highly-Available (HA) Deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If desired, multiple distributed worker nodes may be associated to the same |morpheus| appliance to eliminate a single point of failure should a distributed worker node go down. Configure each distributed worker node using the same worker key (process described in the prior section) and add redundancy using as many additional workers nodes as needed. When multiple worker nodes are using the same worker key, proxy calls will always go through the primary worker node when possible. The primary node is the first worker node configured using a specific worker key. When necessary, automatic failover will take place and another active worker node will be used. While proxy calls will always try to use the primary node when available, |morpheus| Agent communications can be balanced equally across worker nodes by placing a VIP in front of your distributed workers.
