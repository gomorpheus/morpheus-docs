- **Issue Date:** 10-06-2022
- **Updated On:** 10-06-2022
- **CVE(s):** CVE-2022-42456
- **Synopsis:** A potential command injection vulnerability within integrations using command execution utility form has been discovered within |morpheus| 5.4.0-1 through 5.4.9-1 (LTS) and in 5.5.0-1 through 5.5.1-4 (standard) due to an input sanitization failure.

Impacted Product Versions
-------------------------

|morpheus| 5.4.0-1 through 5.4.9-1 (LTS) and in 5.5.0-1 through 5.5.1-4 (standard)

Advisory Details
----------------

A potential command injection vulnerability within integrations using command execution utility form has been discovered within |morpheus| 5.4.0-1 through 5.4.9-1 (LTS) and in 5.5.0-1 through 5.5.1-4 (standard) due to an input sanitization failure.

To successfully execute an injection on the appliance, a bad actor must be authenticated to the |morpheus| application with permission to run integration commands. Integrations affected are Ansible, Terraform, and Kubernetes.

As a workaround, customers can update their user feature role to "None" for the integration, which is labeled under ‘Integrations.’

Alternatively, customers can set the role permission for "Library: Integrations" to "Read."

The system user which commands for Ansible and Terraform are run as on the |morpheus| appliance is restricted and does not have elevated privileges such as sudo. The system user for Kubernetes is the |morpheus| application user, which is a restricted user but may have access to sensitive configuration data used by the |morpheus| application.

We recommend that customers upgrade the |morpheus| appliance to version 5.4.10-2 (LTS), 5.5.2 (Standard), or later.
