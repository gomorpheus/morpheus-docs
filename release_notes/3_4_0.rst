v3.4.0
=======

Release Date: 6/19/2018

.. IMPORTANT:: Morpheus v3.4.0 adds support for subtenant users to login via the main tenant url using subtenant id or subdomain prefix, ie ``subtentantId\username`` or ``subdomain\username``. Subtenant local users will no longer be able to login from main login url without using subtenant id or subdomain prefix. Tenant subdomain can be defined by editing the Tenant settings and updating the `SUBDOMAIN` field.
