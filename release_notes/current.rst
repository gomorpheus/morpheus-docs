|morphver| Release Notes
*************************

- Compatible Plugin API version: |pluginVer|
- Compatible Morpheus Worker version: |workerVer|

.. important::

   Known issue with embedded Elasticsearch upgrade: When upgrading to v5.4.8, v5.4.9 or v5.5.1, there is a potential issue with embedded Elasticsearch clustering on rolling upgrades and existing data migration for all embedded Elasticsearch architechtures. Release versions with a fix will be posted soon. The issue can be mitigated by running the following after installing/upgrading the v5.4.8, 5.4.9 or 5.5.1 package and PRIOR to running reconfigure.

   As root, after installing/upgrading the v5.4.8, 5.4.9 or 5.5.1 package and PRIOR to running reconfigure, run the following:

   .. code-block:: bash

     	rm -f /var/opt/morpheus/elasticsearch
     	mv /var/opt/morpheus/elasticsearch-7.8.1 /var/opt/morpheus/elasticsearch-7.17.5
     	morpheus-ctl reconfigure

.. important::  Security: CVE-2022-35912: Morpheus v5.5.1-3 and v5.4.8-2 are now available in response to CVE-2022-35912, a Grails Framework remote code execution vulnerability. v5.5.1-2, v5.5.1-3 and v5.4.8-2 include the Grails v5.1.9 update that mitigates the vulnerability. At this time, the Grails vulnerability is only confirmed for grails frameworks running on Java 8. Morpheus versions v5.4.4 and higher are on Java 11. Customers on morpheus v5.4.3 or earlier are highly advised to upgrade to at minimum v5.4.4 or higher, and out of an abundance of caution we recommend all customers upgrade to v5.5.1-3 or v5.4.8-2 in the event the vulnerability is found to be exploitable on Java 11.

.. important:: Morpheus |morphver| requires Morpheus Worker |workerVer|. Please upgrade any existing Morpheus Workers to the |workerVer| Worker package to ensure compatibility with Morpheus |morphver|.

.. NOTE:: Items appended with :superscript:`5.x.x` are also included in that version
