|morphver| |releasetype| Release Notes
**************************************

.. WARNING:: |morpheus| |morphver| only supports rolling upgrades for HA environments when upgrading from v6.0.2.

- Compatible Plugin API version: |pluginVer|
- Compatible |morpheus| Worker version: |workerVer|

.. IMPORTANT:: In |morpheus| |morphver|, many third party integrations have been moved out of the core installer package and converted to |morpheus| plugins. As a result, during the upgrade process your appliance will need to be able to access share.morpheusdata.com, the online repository for all |morpheus| plugins. Where this is not possible, users may instead apply the supplemental installer package which is also available at |morpheus| Hub alongside the main installer package.

.. IMPORTANT:: NSX-V support is deprecated though still supported as of |morpheus| 6.0.0. It will be removed and unsupported in 6.1.1 and higher.

.. NOTE:: Items appended with :superscript:`x.x.x` are also included in that version
