New Features
============

:Dashboard: - The Dashboard plugin has been updated to support German, French, and Italian localizations :superscript:`6.2.7`
:DigitalOcean: - The native DigitalOcean Cloud integration has been replaced by a plugin offering identical capability. For most users, this change will be invisible as the plugin is automatically downloaded and applied on upgrade or installation

Fixes
=====

:API & CLI: - Access token refresh is now working properly. If the call is made while the token is valid, the ``expires_in`` property indicates how many more seconds until it expires. If the access token has expired, it refreshes the token and resets the expire date :superscript:`6.2.7`
