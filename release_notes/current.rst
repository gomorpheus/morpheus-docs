New Features
============

:HVM: - Added attach and detach actions for cluster volumes to the Volumes subtab within the Storage tab on cluster detail pages. Click the gear (|gear|) icon to access these actions
      - When provisioning VMs to |clusters|, added the ability to specify the disk type and mountpoint (VirtIO, SATA). Edit the Cloud and mark ENABLE DISK TYPE SELECTION under Advanced Options to enable in the provisioning wizard
      - Added "HPE dark" as a theme selection in User Settings 
:NSX: - Added iPv6 DHCP configuration for NSX segments
:ServiceNow: - Added support for ServiceNow Xanadu and Yokohama
:Roles: - Added "List" level rights to the "Tools: Cypher" Role permission. "List" access allows the user to list out available Cypher entries in |morpheus| UI or API but not to consume them in scripts or decrypt them in any way

Fixes
=====

:Azure: - When Instance tags are updated in the Azure portal, they are now picked up on the next Cloud sync without having to perform some other action to cause them to be picked up
:Catalog: - Fixed Network dropdown emptying when the Group selection was made and re-made multiple times
:Checks: - Fixed Windows Agent Checks executing the check every minute regardless of the defined interval on the Check
:Identity Sources: - When a user is created using a Custom External SSO identity source, the token expiration period is now correct to the interval set in global client settings rather than defaulting to one year
:Kubernetes: - Improved UI warnings when the ``kind`` field is missing at the root of the Kubernetes spec. Previously, the Instance appeared to deploy in the UI but no resources were actually deployed to the cluster
:Library: - Fixed an issue that could cause "Server Threw a Gasket" UI warnings when editing an existing custom Instance Type in a Subtenant
:MaaS: - The bare metal server's power state is now updated by subsequent syncs in addition to the initial sync
:Nutanix Prism Central: - Fixed tag creation for Nutanix Prism Central Instances generated by Terraform
:OpenStack: - Fixed Datastore types not displaying in Instance details when OpenStack Instances were provisioned with "Auto Datastore" selected
             - Fixed Plan resizing for OpenStack Instances to improve handling of updated CPU cores and storage specs
             - Fixed a scenario where an incorrect max storage value could be listed for OpenStack Instances (ex. 13GB of 0GB used)
             - Fixed an issue that could cause incorrect IP address assignment after reconfigure of OpenStack Instances
             - Fixed an issue that prevented creation of OpenStack Security Groups when the trailing slash ("/") was left off the identity URL
             - Fixed missing datastore details for discovered VMs
             - |morpheus| now correctly syncs OpenStack routers created without a name (allowed in OpenStack)
:Oracle Cloud: - Oracle Cloud integrations can now sync more than 100 Compartments
:Rubrik: - Fixed backup durations being lost after an integration sync
          - Removed the retention count configuration for Rubrik backups as they did not apply to that backup type
:Security Groups: - Subtenant users no longer see Security Groups that are associated with Clouds which haven't been shared with the Tenant
:VMware: - Fixed an issue that could cause the max memory metric displayed on the Instance detail page to occasionally be greater than the memory available to the Instance
          - Fixed an issue with French language hypervisor console keymaps
:Veeam: - Fixed backup jobs failing to sync when large numbers of VMs were attached
:XenServer: - Multiple improvements added related to backups
