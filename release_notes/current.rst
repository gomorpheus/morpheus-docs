|morphver| Release Notes
*************************

Release Date: |releasedate|

.. IMPORTANT:: This release includes improvements to Amazon AWS price sync. After upgrading, it is recommended that you manually perform a "Daily" refresh on Amazon Clouds to ensure availability of Amazon Service Plans for each region. To manually refresh a Cloud, navigate to Infrastructure > Clouds > (Selected Amazon Cloud) and select "Daily" from the REFRESH dropdown menu. If this is not done, |morpheus| may not show Amazon Service Plans in the provisioning wizard until after Midnight UTC following the upgrade when the next automatic Daily sync would run.

.. IMPORTANT:: Support has been removed for exposing Instance Types and App Blueprints to the ServiceNow catalog via |morpheus| integration. This is because more advanced configurations of Instances and App Blueprints, in addition to Workflows, can be exposed utilizing Catalog Items. Following upgrade, Instance Types and App Blueprints which were previously exposed will be disabled from the ServiceNow catalog. Any important configurations will need to be replaced with Service Catalog Items. See our `ServiceNow integration guide <https://docs.morpheusdata.com/en/5.4.2/integration_guides/ITSM/ServiceNow.html#adding-to-servicenow-catalog>`_ for instructions on how to expose |morpheus| Catalog Items to ServiceNow.

.. NOTE:: v5.4.2-2 fixes 5.4.2-1 js event target issue with instance lists and modals.

.. NOTE:: Items appended with :superscript:`5.x.x` are also included in that version.

New Features
============

:API & CLI: - NSX-T load balancers can now be created and managed from |morpheus| API and CLI :superscript:`5.2.14`
             - Option to expose |morpheus| Instance Types and Blueprints to ServiceNow via |morpheus| API and CLI has been removed which matches the change made to |morpheus| UI
:Backups: - UI wizard is now displayed when restoring from Backup, including option to restore to new Instance or restore to the existing Instance. This can be done from the Backups tab on the Instance detail page or the Backup detail page
:Inputs: - Inputs (previously Option Types) have two additional attributes, one which displays the Input when editing an Instance and a second which allows displayed Inputs to be updated when editing the Instance
:Library: - Create Layouts and Instance Types representing XaaS constructs with no specific VM or container type behind it. Pricing and Workflow phases can be utilized as with other Instance Types. Added new technology type of "Workflow" for Layouts to support this
:ServiceNow: - Instances and Blueprints can no longer be exposed to ServiceNow for provisioning from the ServiceNow. Instead, |morpheus| Catalog Items (which can be built from existing Instance Type and Blueprints) are the only construct which can now be exposed
:UI: - Improved UI on the Instance History tab, including ability to see raw history output, and timeline of executed Tasks, along with the success of each Task
