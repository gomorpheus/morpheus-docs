|morphver| |releasetype| Release Notes
**************************************

- Compatible Plugin API version: |pluginVer|
- Compatible Morpheus Worker version: |workerVer|

.. IMPORTANT:: In |morpheus| |morphver|, many third party integrations have been moved out of the core installer package and converted to |morpheus| plugins. As a result, during the upgrade process your appliance will need to be able to access share.morpheusdata.com, the online repository for all |morpheus| plugins. Where this is not possible, users may instead apply the supplemental installer package which is also available at |morpheus| Hub alongside the main installer package.

.. NOTE:: Items appended with :superscript:`5.x.x` are also included in that version
