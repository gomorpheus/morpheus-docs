Unmanaged vs Managed
--------------------

|morpheus| can sync/inventory existing Virtual Machines from Integrated Clouds. By default, synced VM's are set to Type "Unmanaged". Unmanaged vm/host records are synced in from a Cloud Inventory, or manually added. Managed VM/Host records are from Provisioned Instances, or Unmanaged VM/Host records that have been Converted to Managed.
