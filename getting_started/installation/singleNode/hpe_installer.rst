Deploying Morpheus with the HPE Installer (Recommended)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The HPE Morpheus Manager Installer is a graphical wizard that deploys Morpheus Enterprise or VM Essentials to an HPE HVM host in minutes. It handles the entire deployment process including image upload, VM creation, network configuration, and post-deployment verification.

The installer is available on the HVM ISO file in two versions:

- **macOS**: ``Morpheus_Manager_Installer-x64-<version>.dmg``
- **Windows**: ``Morpheus_Manager_Installer-x64-<version>.zip``

.. note:: Deployment duration depends on image size, source method, network throughput, host storage, and first-boot processing. Use the phase and log output described below to judge progress rather than relying on a fixed duration.

.. important:: A local QCOW2 deployment does not require internet access, but the deployed Manager's Ubuntu base OS still requires an HPE-approved APT source for ongoing updates. Before production use, plan either approved repository access or an internal mirror. See :doc:`Morpheus Manager Base OS Updates </getting_started/maintenance/manager_os_updates>`.

Prerequisites and Assumptions
`````````````````````````````

Before using the installer, ensure the following:

- Each HVM host has an IP address, netmask, and gateway already configured
- You have SSH access (port 22) to the target HVM host from your workstation
- You have HTTPS access (port 443) to the HVM host for post-deployment verification
- The SSH user has sudo privileges to run ``virsh``, ``hvmcli``, and manage HVM resources
- You have the HPE VM Essentials QCOW2 image ready (available on the HVM ISO or as an HTTP URL)
- You know the network configuration details for the Morpheus VM. The **Netmask** value must use dotted-decimal notation (for example, ``255.255.224.0``), not a CIDR prefix or address such as ``/19`` or ``172.16.32.0/19``

Starting the Installer
``````````````````````

1. Mount or extract the HVM ISO file on your workstation
2. Locate the installer for your platform:

   - **macOS**: Open the ``.dmg`` file and launch the HPE Morpheus Manager Installer application
   - **Windows**: Extract the ``.zip`` file and run the installer executable

3. The installer opens with the **Prerequisites** screen

Step 1: Prerequisites
`````````````````````

The Welcome screen provides an overview of how the deployment works:

1. **Configure** — Enter SSH credentials, network settings, and VM configuration through the wizard
2. **Upload & Deploy** — The installer uploads the QCOW2 image and runs ``hvmcli`` to create and configure the VM
3. **Verify & Access** — Cloud-init configures the VM, and the installer verifies the application is ready

.. image:: /images/getting_started/installation/installer/prerequisites.png
   :alt: HPE Morpheus Installer - Prerequisites screen

Before continuing, confirm each prerequisite in the **Before You Start** checklist:

- **SSH access to the HVM host** — Ensure you can reach the target host over SSH (port 22) from this machine
- **HTTPS access to the HVM host** — The host must be reachable over HTTPS (port 443) for post-deploy verification
- **User has sudo privileges** — The SSH user must have sudo access to run ``virsh``, ``hvmcli``, and manage HVM resources
- **QCOW2 image available** — Have the HPE VM Essentials QCOW2 image ready — either a local file or an HTTP URL
- **Network configuration details** — Know the IP address, netmask, gateway, and DNS for the virtual machine

Once all items are confirmed, click **Next**.

.. image:: /images/getting_started/installation/installer/prerequisites_confirmed.png
   :alt: HPE Morpheus Installer - All prerequisites confirmed

Step 2: SSH Connection
``````````````````````

Configure the SSH connection to the target HVM hypervisor host where the Morpheus VM will be deployed.

.. image:: /images/getting_started/installation/installer/ssh_connection.png
   :alt: HPE Morpheus Installer - SSH Connection screen

- **Host** — The IP address or hostname of the HVM host
- **Port** — SSH port (default: ``22``)
- **Username** — SSH user (e.g., ``ubuntu``)
- **Authentication Method** — Choose between **Password** or **SSH Key** authentication
- **Password** — Enter the password for the SSH user (if using password authentication)

Click **Test Connection** to verify connectivity. The installer will:

1. Establish an SSH connection to the host
2. Verify the host-key fingerprint (you must accept it on first connection)
3. Detect the existing management virtSwitch on the host

.. image:: /images/getting_started/installation/installer/ssh_connection_connected.png
   :alt: HPE Morpheus Installer - SSH connection verified

Once connected and the host identity is verified, click **Next**.

Step 3: VM Network
``````````````````

Configure the static network settings for the Morpheus appliance VM. This is the IP address that will be assigned to the Morpheus VM itself.

.. image:: /images/getting_started/installation/installer/vm_network.png
   :alt: HPE Morpheus Installer - VM Network configuration

- **IP Address** — Static IP address for the Morpheus VM
- **Netmask** — Subnet mask in dotted-decimal notation (for example, ``255.255.252.0``). Do not enter CIDR notation (for example, ``/22`` or ``192.168.0.0/22``)
- **Gateway** — Default gateway for the VM
- **DNS Servers** — One or more DNS servers (click the **x** to remove entries, or add more as needed)
- **Appliance URL (optional)** — Custom URL for accessing the Morpheus appliance (e.g., ``https://morpheus.example.com``)

Click **Next** to proceed.

.. warning:: The Manager installer can accept a CIDR-formatted Netmask without rejecting the field, but the Manager deployment can subsequently fail. Return to VM Network configuration and enter the equivalent dotted-decimal mask before retrying. This differs from HVM host and ``hvmcli`` address inputs that are documented with CIDR notation.

Step 4: Host Network
````````````````````

Configure the host management uplink. A management virtSwitch is created on the host before deployment (or reused if one already exists).

.. image:: /images/getting_started/installation/installer/host_network.png
   :alt: HPE Morpheus Installer - Host Network configuration

- **Management virtSwitch** — Displays the detected management virtSwitch (e.g., ``virtSwitch0 already exists on this host and will be reused``)

Optional settings:

- **Use Compute VLAN** — Enable if you want the Morpheus appliance VM to be deployed on a specific VLAN. When a VLAN ID is provided, the Morpheus appliance will be deployed using this VLAN for its network connectivity. When checked:

  - **Compute Interface** — Select the host interface for the compute network bridge
  - **Compute VLAN Tag** — The VLAN ID to use for the Morpheus appliance network

- **Use HTTP Proxy** — Enable if the environment requires an HTTP proxy. When checked:

  - **Proxy URL** — The proxy server URL (e.g., ``http://proxy:8080``)
  - **No Proxy** — Comma-separated list of hosts to bypass the proxy (e.g., ``localhost,127.0.0.1``)

.. image:: /images/getting_started/installation/installer/host_network_options.png
   :alt: HPE Morpheus Installer - Host Network with VLAN and Proxy options

Click **Next** to proceed.

Step 5: VM Configuration
````````````````````````

Configure the Morpheus appliance virtual machine settings.

.. image:: /images/getting_started/installation/installer/vm_configuration.png
   :alt: HPE Morpheus Installer - VM Configuration

**VM Settings:**

- **Hostname** — The hostname for the Morpheus VM (e.g., ``morpheus-app``)
- **VM Size** — Select a VM sizing profile:

  - Small (12 GB RAM, 2 vCPUs)
  - Medium
  - Large

Choose a profile based on the expected managed hosts, VMs, total objects, enabled integrations, and workload. The profiles do not establish a fixed number of HVM clusters that a Manager can manage. For published limits and guidance on values that are not published, see :doc:`HPE VM Essentials Maximums </infrastructure/clusters/hvm/maximums>`. Contact HPE for a workload-specific sizing review before committing to a large deployment.

- **QCOW2 Image** — Path to the HPE VM Essentials QCOW2 image. Use the **Browse** button to locate the file on the ISO volume (e.g., ``hpe-vm-essentials-9.0.0-1.qcow2.gz``), or enter an HTTP URL
- **Expected SHA256 Checksum (optional)** — If provided, the local image file's SHA256 will be verified before upload

For a local path, the workstation remains in the image-transfer path until upload completes. For a URL, the target host must be able to resolve and reach the source. URL use can avoid a slow workstation or VPN path, but it does not guarantee a shorter transfer. Use a trusted source and provide the publisher's SHA256 checksum when available.

**Appliance First-Boot Configuration:**

These fields configure the initial setup of the Morpheus appliance after deployment:

- **Appliance Name** — Name of the Morpheus appliance (e.g., ``Morpheus``)
- **Initial Tenant Name** — Name of the initial tenant (e.g., ``Master Tenant``)
- **Admin Username** — Administrator username (e.g., ``admin``)
- **Admin Password** — Password for the administrator account
- **Admin Email** — Email address for the administrator
- **First Name** / **Last Name** — Administrator's name

Click **Next** to proceed to the review step.

Step 6: Review & Preflight Check
`````````````````````````````````

The final step before deployment. The installer runs preflight checks to validate your configuration and displays a summary.

.. image:: /images/getting_started/installation/installer/review_preflight.png
   :alt: HPE Morpheus Installer - Review and Preflight Check

**Preflight Checks:**

- SSH connection to host
- ``hvmcli`` present + passwordless sudo
- IP address format valid
- Hostname format valid
- Image path specified
- Management uplink set

All checks must pass (shown in green) before you can deploy. If any check fails, click **Re-run** to retry or go back to correct the configuration.

**Configuration Summary:**

Review the full configuration summary including SSH target, VM IP, netmask/gateway, DNS, hostname, VM size, image path, admin user, management uplink, compute interface, and proxy settings.

When satisfied, click **Deploy** to start the deployment.

Deployment Progress
```````````````````

Once deployment begins, the installer displays a real-time progress view showing each step:

.. image:: /images/getting_started/installation/installer/deploying.png
   :alt: HPE Morpheus Installer - Deployment in progress

The deployment steps include:

1. Preparing host virtSwitch
2. Validating deployment parameters
3. Running pre-flight checks
4. Preparing KVM hypervisor
5. Configuring management network
6. Configuring compute network
7. Creating local storage pool
8. Downloading QCOW2 image
9. Building cloud-init configuration
10. Defining virtual machine
11. Starting virtual machine
12. Waiting for Morpheus services to start
13. Running post-deploy health checks
14. Cleaning up temporary files

A **Cancel Deployment** button is available if you need to abort the process.

Troubleshooting a Failed Deployment
````````````````````````````````````

If the deployment encounters an error, the installer clearly indicates which step failed and provides troubleshooting options.

.. image:: /images/getting_started/installation/installer/deployment_failed.png
   :alt: HPE Morpheus Installer - Deployment Failed

Click **What went wrong** (or **Hide details**) to expand error details showing the specific error message.

.. image:: /images/getting_started/installation/installer/deployment_failed_details.png
   :alt: HPE Morpheus Installer - Deployment failure details

**What to try:**

- Check the deployment logs for more details
- Try restarting the deployment from scratch
- If the issue persists, collect logs and contact support

**Available actions:**

- **View Logs** — Opens the local log directory containing ``main.log`` with detailed deployment trace
- **Export Report** — Exports a deployment report for support purposes
- **Retry Deployment** — Retry the deployment from the beginning
- **Back to Configuration** — Return to the configuration wizard to adjust settings

.. image:: /images/getting_started/installation/installer/view_logs.png
   :alt: HPE Morpheus Installer - Viewing deployment logs

.. tip:: Host-side logs are also available at ``/var/log/hvmcli/`` on the HVM host for additional troubleshooting.

Large Image Uploads and Timeout
```````````````````````````````

The installer UI has a **60-minute timeout** for the image upload step. For very large QCOW2 images or slow network connections, the upload may exceed this limit.

**Pre-staging the image manually:**

If you anticipate the upload will take longer than 60 minutes, you can manually transfer the QCOW2 image to the host beforehand. The installer uploads images to:

.. code-block:: text

   /var/lib/libvirt/images/

To have the installer skip the upload and discover a pre-existing image on the host, place the file at:

.. code-block:: bash

   /var/lib/libvirt/images/<filename>.qcow2

The installer checks the file size using ``stat -c '%s' /var/lib/libvirt/images/<filename>`` — if the file exists and has the same size as the local source file, the upload step is skipped automatically.

**Example — manually uploading via SCP:**

.. code-block:: bash

   scp hpe-vm-essentials-9.1.0-1.qcow2 ubuntu@<hvm-host>:/var/lib/libvirt/images/

.. note:: Ensure the filename on the host matches exactly what the installer expects (i.e., the same filename you selected in the QCOW2 Image field). The size comparison must also match — do not rename or truncate the file.

Installer Data Locations
````````````````````````

The HPE Morpheus Manager Installer stores configuration, logs, and state data locally on the workstation. If you need to start fresh (e.g., clear saved settings, reset SSH trust, or troubleshoot a corrupted state), you can delete these files.

**macOS:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Path
     - Contents
   * - ``~/Library/Application Support/Morpheus Manager Installer/``
     - Configuration and state files (see below)
   * - ``~/Library/Logs/Morpheus Manager Installer/``
     - Application log files (daily rotation, 10 MB max per file)

**Windows:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Path
     - Contents
   * - ``%APPDATA%\Morpheus Manager Installer\``
     - Configuration and state files (see below)
   * - ``%APPDATA%\Morpheus Manager Installer\logs\``
     - Application log files (daily rotation, 10 MB max per file)

**Stored Files:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - File
     - Purpose
   * - ``session-config.json``
     - Saves the last-used deployment settings (SSH host, IP, network config, VM size, etc.) so they are pre-populated on next launch. Passwords are **not** stored.
   * - ``cluster-config.json``
     - Saves cluster wizard settings (cluster name, datastore config). Secrets are redacted before persisting.
   * - ``cluster-state.json``
     - Tracks whether the last cluster deployment succeeded (used for resume/retry logic).
   * - ``known_hosts.json``
     - Stores SSH host fingerprints for HVM hosts you have connected to. Used to detect host key changes (similar to ``~/.ssh/known_hosts``).
   * - ``known_certs.json``
     - Stores trusted TLS certificate fingerprints for Morpheus appliances with self-signed or untrusted certificates.

**Resetting the Installer:**

To completely reset the installer to a clean state:

**macOS:**

.. code-block:: bash

   rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Morpheus\ Manager\ Installer/
   rm -rf ~/Library/Logs/Morpheus\ Manager\ Installer/

**Windows (PowerShell):**

.. code-block:: powershell

   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:APPDATA\Morpheus Manager Installer"

.. tip:: If you are only experiencing SSH host key warnings (e.g., after re-imaging a host), you can delete just ``known_hosts.json`` rather than resetting everything.
