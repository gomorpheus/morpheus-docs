3-Node HA Upgrade
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Current 3-Node HA appliances use three application nodes with RabbitMQ and Elasticsearch services clustered across those nodes. The Transactional Database Tier remains outside the application nodes; all three application nodes use the same external MySQL cluster or supported MySQL service. Do not convert this topology to co-located MySQL as part of an upgrade.
