Requirements
============

|morpheus| is a software based appliance installation capable of orchestrating many clouds and hypervisors. Before an installation is started it is important to understand some of the base requirements.

In the simplest configuration |morpheus| needs one Appliance Server. The Appliance Server, by default, contains all the components necessary to orchestrate both VMs and containers. To get started some base requirements are recommended:

Base Requirements

   * - OS
     - Version(s)
     - Notes
   * - Amazon Linux
     - 2
     -
   * - CentOS Stream
     - 8.x
     -
   * - Debian
     - |debianVersion|
     - FreeRDP 2.0 is not compatible with Debian 9. Guacd will remain at 1.0.0 for Appliances running on 9.
   * - RHEL
     - 7.x, 8.x
     -
   * - SUSE SLES
     - 12, 15
     -
   * - Ubuntu
     - 16.04, 18.04, 20.04
     - 14.04 is no longer supported for Appliance OS. Existing Appliances on 14.04 must upgrade to 16.04 or 18.04 PRIOR to upgrading to v4.2.1. Note: 14.04 is still supported by the |morpheus| Agent.

- **Memory:** `16 GB recommended <https://support.morpheusdata.com/s/article/How-does-Morpheus-manage-the-memory-it-uses?language=en_US>`_ for default installations. 8 GB minimum required with 4 GB+ available storage swap space
- **Storage:** 200 GB storage minimum (see Storage Considerations below)
- **CPU:** 4-core, 1.4 GHz (or better), 64-bit CPU recommended for all-in-one systems. For a distributed-tier installation, it's recommended each tier have 2-core, 1.4 GHz (or better), 64-bit CPU
- Network connectivity from your users to the appliance over TCP 443 (HTTPS)
- Superuser privileges via the ``sudo`` command for the user installing the |morpheus| appliance package
- Access to base ``yum`` or ``apt`` repositories. ``codeready`` (codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms) repo access is required for RHEL 8+ appliances and access to the Optional RPMs repo is required for RHEL 7.x
- An appliance license is required for any operations involving provisioning
- Current major web browsers supporting modern standards, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge are supported
- Internet Connectivity (optional)
   - To download from |morpheus|' public docker repositories and system Virtual Image catalog
   - Offline installation requires installing the supplemental package in addition to the regular installation package. Local yum/apt repo access still required for offline installations.

.. NOTE:: Access to ``yum`` and ``apt`` repos is still required for offline installations.

-  VM and Host Agent Install (optional)
    - Inbound connectivity access from provisioned VMs and container hosts on port 443 (Agent install and communication). Port 80 may be required for older ``apt`` distros.

    - An Appliance URL that is accessible/resolvable to all managed hosts. It is necessary for all hosts that are managed by |morpheus| to be able to communicate with the appliance server ip on port 443. This URL is configured under |AdmSet|.

.. NOTE:: Ubuntu 16.10 is not currently supported.

Storage Considerations
----------------------

Upon initial installation |morpheus| takes up less than 10 GB of space, however |morpheus| Services, Virtual Images, Backups, Logs, stats, and user-uploaded and imported data require adequate space on the |morpheus| Appliance(s) based on appliance configuration and activity. |morpheus| recommends at least 200 GB as a general figure to start from but storage needs will vary dramatically based on each specific use case. In some cases, significantly more space will be needed.

.. IMPORTANT:: It is the customer's responsibility to ensure adequate storage space per configuration and use case. The appliance should be properly monitored to ensure it does not run low on disk space.

Default Paths
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``/opt/morpheus``
  Morpheus Application and Services Files
``/var/opt/morpheus``
  User, Application and Services Data, including default config Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ and Database data, and default Virtual Image path.
``/var/log``
  Morpheus Service logs
``/tmp/morpheus``
  Working directory for Backups

Images
^^^^^^

Virtual Images can be uploaded to |morpheus| Storage Providers for use across Clouds. By default when no Storage Provider has been added, images will write to ``/var/opt/morpheus/morpheus-ui/vms``. Please ensure adequate space when uploading Images using local file paths.

Backups
^^^^^^^

|morpheus| can offload snapshots when performing backups to local or other Storage Providers. By default when no Storage Provider has been added, backups will write to ``/tmp/morpheus/backups/``. When using none NFS Storage providers, the backup file(s) must be written to ``/tmp/morpheus/working/`` before they can be zipped, sent to the destination Storage provider such as S3, and removed from ``/tmp/morpheus/working/``. Please ensure adequate space in ``/tmp/morpheus/`` when offloading Backups.

Migrations
^^^^^^^^^^

When performing a Hypervisor to Hypervisor migration, such as VMware to AWS, Virtual Images are written to local storage before conversion and/or upload to the target hypervisor. Please ensure adequate space in ``/var/opt/morpheus/morpheus-ui/vms`` or other configured local Storage Provider paths when performing Migrations.

VM Logs and Stats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using |morpheus| with a locally-installed Elasticsearch configuration, VM, Container, Host and Appliance logs and stats are are stored in Elasticsearch. Please ensure adequate space in ``/var``, specifically ``/var/opt/morpheus/elasticsearch`` in relation to the number of Instances reporting logs, log frequency, and log retention count. With partition space at 85% filled or higher (by default), Elasticsearch will enter an unhealthy state and the |morpheus| appliance will not function properly.

|morpheus| Services Logs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Logs for services local to the |morpheus| Appliance, such as the Morpheus UI, elasticsearch, rabbitmq, mysql, nginx and guacd are written to ``/var/log/morpheus/``. Current logs are rotated nightly, zipped, and files older than 30 days are automatically removed. Misconfigured services, ports and permissions can cause excessive log file sizes.

Network Connectivity
--------------------

|morpheus| primarily operates via communication with its Agent that is installed on all managed VMs or docker hosts. This is a lightweight agent responsible for aggregating logs and stats and sending them back to the client with minimal network traffic overhead. It also is capable of processing instructions related to provisioning and deployments instigated by the appliance server.

The |morpheus| Agent exists for both Linux and Windows-based platforms and opens NO ports on the guest operating system. Instead it makes an outbound SSL (HTTPS/WSS) connection to the appliance server. This is what is known as the ``appliance url`` during configuration (in |AdmSet|). When the Agent is started it automatically makes this connection and securely authenticates. Therefore, it is necessary for
all VMs and docker based hosts that are managed by |morpheus| to be able to reach the appliance server IP on port 443.

|morpheus| has numerous methods to execute Agent installation, including zero open port methods.

Components
----------

The Appliance Server automatically installs several components for the operation of |morpheus|. This includes:

-  RabbitMQ (Messaging)
-  MySQL (Logistical Data store)
-  Elasticsearch (Logs / Metrics store)
-  Tomcat (|morpheus| Application)
-  Nginx (Web frontend)
-  Guacamole (Remote console service for clientless remote console)
-  Check Server (Monitoring Agent for custom checks added via UI)

All of these are installed in an isolated way using chef zero to ``/opt/morpheus``. It is also important to note these services can be
offloaded to separate servers or clusters as desired. For details check the installation section and high availability.

SELinux
-------

If not required by organizational policy, we recommend setting SELinux to "Permissive" or "Disabled" modes to prevent any unnecessary security-related issues. |morpheus| versions 3.6.0 and higher do support "Enforcing" mode if it is required by your organization due to IT policies. Set the mode appropriately prior to running the |morpheus| installer and it will make the required changes based on your chosen SELinux context.

.. IMPORTANT:: Setting SELinux to "Enforcing" mode requires policies to be configured correctly in order for the |morpheus| appliance to function correctly.

Supported Locales
-------------------

Morpheus supports a number of different UI locales, including:

  - English
  - French
  - German
  - Spanish
  - Chinese (Simplified)
  - Portuguese (Brazil)
  - Korean
  - Italian

The full list of supported locales can be viewed within the Morpheus UI via the "Default Appliance Locale" select list within Administration Settings.

Switching Locales
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The language of text in the Morpheus UI can be changed by telling the Morpheus server which locale to use. A Locale is made up of a language code and a country code. For example "en_US" is the code for US English, whilst "en_GB" is the code for British English. When using the Morpheus UI software through a client, the Morpheus UI software server will send the UI text back to the client using the appropriate static Language Pack. All translations returned via Morpheus Internationalization have been made and approved prior to the Morpheus UI version release.

**Via Locale Settings in the Morpheus UI:**
An application wide default locale can be configured within the Master Tenant under Administration -> Settings -> Default Appliance Locale. An individual Morpheus user can configure a preferred locale within their user settings. Using a locale setting is the preferred method for switching the Morpheus UI language.

**Via the Accept-Language HTTP header:**
The Accept-Language request HTTP header advertises which languages the client is able to understand, and which locale variant is preferred. Most browsers will by default send a “Accept-Language” HTTP header when visiting websites. The value of Accept-Language will match the configured preference of the browser’s user language/locale settings. The Morpheus UI will automatically detect the Accept-Language header and return the UI text from the corresponding Language Pack where possible. If there is no matching Language Pack the English US language pack is displayed in the UI. If an application locale or user locale setting has been configured in the Morpheus UI, then this will override the user’s browser preferences.

**Via the “lang” query parameter:**
Morpheus has the capability to switch locales by passing a parameter called “lang” to the Morpheus UI request. For example, “operations/dashboard?lang=de” will switch the locale preference to German. Morpheus will automatically switch the user’s locale and store it in a cookie so subsequent requests will have the new header. If a user is unauthenticated then the user’s locale will be reset. To switch a locale back to English pass “?lang=en” as a query parameterin the Morpheus UI request.

.. NOTE:: Many of Morpheus' language packs are generated by our clients. For that reason, we cannot guarantee accuracy and completeness of the translation. As new UI elements are added, existing language sets may not have immediate updates to keep pace with application changes. If you would like to contribute to a new or existing language pack, contact your account team or Morpheus support. Contributed content will be included within the next application version.
