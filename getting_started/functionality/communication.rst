Ports and Protocols
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following table contains communication port and protocol data between |morpheus| appliance tiers, managed machines, and services. All communication to and from |morpheus| goes thru the application tier with exception of inter-cluster communications for each of the |morpheus| tiers when using a distributed architecture.

Ports used to communicate with integrated technologies are those defined for the integrationâs API. They are not represented in this table as many of these are configurable and may be different in each customer environment. Additionally, ports used to complete Morpheus checks are customizable and may vary for each check configured. They are also not represented in this table.
